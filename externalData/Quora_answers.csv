AI is, what you call a self programming program. You give the AI program the data, it will comes out with its own model program to solve the problem.
If that is correct then, you as a human first need to know how to program, and check whether AI has programmed itself correctly. If you find an error in AI behaviour, then you jump in and correct the relevant code.
Learn problem solving by posting your code to online judges. I have written about it in another question. Search for it, you will get some good idea.
Language easiest to pickup currently are, Python, R and recently Julia is becoming popular. Once you master one language then think about C++
have good time learnin."
1,https://www.quora.com/How-can-learning-to-program-make-a-difference-in-your-life/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,20,–,www.quora.com,How-can-learning-to-program-make-a-difference-in-your-life,"Try coding one simplest program on a competitive programming platform like DMOJ. You will understand how life changing it can be. You will know everything about the logic, the syntax will be correct, the code you have typed will be prefect and yet two or three test cases fail.
Hours together is spent to not solve the problem but to learn the problem and take care of every mode of failure that you program can undergo. When you spend that muh time and get the solution correct, means the solution will for sure work in real world. That is how real world excellent programs are written. Excellent programmers can become good leaders, solely for their logical thinking and their thoroughness.
Many who intuitively solve the problem think such level of detail is unwanted. when their solution fails in real world they blame the nature or others.Seldom do they hold themselves responsible. They loose their credibility, get demoted and even loose their jobs.
I have been one of those intuitive thinkers. Now with training in programming I realise how important is Logic along with knowledge about the world and the subject. In fact the subject knowledge is useful to test the program than actually programming. Only the expert can come up with extremely rare test cases because he experienced it. But by persevering with the problem, the programmer can imagine test cases that might create problem and work for the same much before the problem happens.
We are programming in real life at many places. At our work, in our kitchen, with our family and friends. Most of the time we struggle because we missed one important point that comes and haunts us back. With programming, you will force yourself to slowdown. Think through the problem inside out. Those who think logically in these these places will progress faster and more easily.
There are downsides too but they are not logically valid downsides. Like overthinking, laziness and unwanted negative biases. These are there whether you one thinks through the problem or not. Problem solving is more profitable than thinking that solving the problem might lead to new problems. (You see illogic in our biases and negative thinking)
When you ask the question, whether it is Logical? Then your brain automatically compartmentalises the problems that you have and the problem you are working on. Have a great time gaining problem solving skills."

Youtube, Facebook and Amazon are the pioneers. How the service provider will earn and get cash? He resorts to giving away the data, and providing ads. Even OTT providers are thinking about streaming ads.
What if one does not want to watch ads??
Then download the videos of youtube using the python API called Pytube. You can use Kaggle platform to run python scripts and get the youtube files. All it takes is 5 lines of code in you notepad and connection to internet.
In case of pytube, you can download the audio and video seperately. There is lot of information that you can learn from youtube videos thru that library. Ranging from the number of videos the challel has, the views, likes, the author detail. Really a information treasure.
Solution is one of the three
Think how you can contribute to the community. Whether, Youtube or any other service. That is a major recuirement. New ideas are necessary to move the soceity to the next level of development.
Have a great time."
3,https://www.quora.com/How-much-mathematics-is-enough-to-start-learning-how-machine-learning-algorithms-work/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,32,–,www.quora.com,How-much-mathematics-is-enough-to-start-learning-how-machine-learning-algorithms-work,"ML algorithms are conceptually simple, and their underlying math and logic requires higher secondary level math training. Math in ML is not that difficult, and there is no fixed quantity of math that needs to be mastered. Lets take the basic ML algorithm, Linear Regression.
The model created by regression algorithm will be like below equation. Only 2 dimensions are considered. In ML, this dimension goes in range of 10s to even 100s. The idea will remain same. The equation itself can be shown using Python’s Sympy library.
Now for what value of ‘x’ the above model(equation) will have minimum output?
Sympy library can help to plot the graph for us visualise
We can see the there is local minimum values and a global minimum value. One of the algorithm to find these values is Gradient Descent. Linear regression uses gradient descent algorithm to find the value of X so that the loss is minimum. It is called “minimizing the loss”.
Example of visualisation in 3D space. The equation to generate this curve is simple.
Much of the ML and AI models do this “Loss Reduction” at various levels of complexity, in multiple dimensions.. GD algorithm is explained in school level Algebra. You can even implement that in python in simple way once you understand the steps required. This level of math is pre-requisite to those interested in Machine Learning.
Why am I telling this?
When you go into uncharted territory, you better know to use the tools at your disposal. Know them inside out. Math is Swiss Army knife in the forest of AI and ML. Knife is sharp and looks dangerous however we have to learn by using it.
First we cut soft fruits like mango and apple, then move to more hard fruits like water melon and even coconut.
Same way, we have to learn the Math through the visualisation, and theory to effectively master ML and its algorithm. Let the higher levels of Math be abstracted by the scientists, but at the usage level Math needs to be learnt.
Back to GD. Gradient descent algorithm finds the global minimum of the loss function. In order to use ML, we don’t need to know how GD algorithm is implement. The ML libraries abstract that and give us an interface or API to get solution. When the solution is calculated the math knowledge can support in checking if the solution makes sense.
If there is any doubt whether Math can be mastered, then start with simple problems and solve them. There is Project Euler, a platform where you can attempt simple to very complex math problems. There are many online competitive programming judges that provide you challenges and you can write program. The online testing platform will help to check your code."
4,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-problem-solving-techniques-for-programming/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,17,–,www.quora.com,How-can-I-learn-problem-solving-techniques-for-programming,"This secret is not even considered as a secret by best problem solvers in this world. To us, who are newly entering the world of problem solving, software engineering and coding this secret is vey very important.
The Secret
One has to read a lot of solutions to many different problems. (Read on, before you decide to use this strategy)
Lets take the world’s top coder, and how he would have started solving problems at very young age. Whatever his level of genius might be, he has to still look at the answer to know whether he solved the problem correctly. This means, the top coders started reading the solutions, AFTER SOLVING THE PROBLEMS themselves before long time. Here is a ROAD MAP one such Genius coder’s evolution.
Zero Problems Solved:
Our yet to be Genius coder lets call him Top Coder, is last in the line thinking about climbing the ladder of problem solving, competitive programming. The usual process is to take different courses like Data Structures, Programming Language and even problem solving before the first problem is solved. This is fine for learning the programming language at the surface level. Top coder aces it within 2 weeks, by practicing the simple problems provided by the introductory book on the programming language.
50 Problems Solved:
The process continues, top coder solves the problems. No choice. But as a noob, it is very important he practices with simplest problems, and gain confidence. Once he starts gaining confidence more challenging problems are taken up. This is where most of the would be TOP CODERS drop off. Our Top Coder is not one of these dropouts. He regularly bunks work or school to solve the problems. Even at school / work he is thinking about the problem. He has the list of problems he wants to solve with him always… That is his level of determination…
51st problem being attempted
The problem chosen can be very high in complexity or it might need new concept that a layman cannot find out through trial error. When this happens, our Top Coder as beginner looks at the solution and learns from it. He then searches for similar problems, and applies the learning with slight variations.
He learns to come up with good test cases and starts sharpening his solutions so all the test cases are passing. Modular programming becomes his mantra. The notepads are filled up, and new refill pens are purchased. The next couple of problems might be partially solved, and other problems can be a road block and doesn’t allow him to progress. He pushes on forward and onwards
75 Solutions read : 60 problems solved:
This is the situation where learning curve of Top Coder is becoming steeper. Brain which is untrained till date, gets chance to make some new connections. The problems solved increases at slower rate. Top coder has already finished 3 books on various problem solving techniques, and another 6 or 8 is left. The time he spends on solving the problems increases from 30 ~ 60 mins to 3 hours. The days start flying without any break or his knowledge.
150 solutions read : 100 problems solved: (Re Solve with different Programming Language)
That is a milestone in Top Coder journey of becoming The Problem Solver. He has solved 100 problems all by himself, and he has read additional 50 problem’s solution. Now he “Re - Solves” some random problems that he had read the solutions in the past, as well as those problems that he solved himself. The top coder does this by learning a different programming language and hones his skills. He gets 2 things done with one activity. Efficient
150 Problems solved : Algorithm design & Efficiencies:
Over 250 to 300 solutions has been read and understood. Many of the notes taken is safely tucked in his repo or some note keeping software. Notes are ready for him to search. Now the problems are complex enough that multiple problems needs to be solved in certain sequence to achieve the results. More like chaining. This is when the design of new algorithms comes in. Efficiency in programming is the time taken by the program to run. The pros call it Big O notation. Top Coder learns about it at this stage, and even find algorithms that have better efficiencies.
Intermediate and Beyond:
More than 450 problems, read, understood and solved. Our Top Coder is at the intermediate levels. More like getting “Blue Belt” in Karate terms. Black Belt needs more training, additional practice and lot more involvement in finding solutions. Here on there will be NO READING THE SOLUTION AT ANY COST. This constraint will push the limits of Top Coder’s capabilities. He understands himself, and starts solving problems in his own style.
500 to 600 Problems solved:
Let us imagine for a moment you are that Top Coder, and you are at this stage. How will you feel? What will be your confidence level. What kind of challenges you might take up next? This has to be the goal of the Top Problem solver. It is a journey that has end only when your consciousness stops to exist. Enjoy every step of the journey. See you on the other side."
5,https://www.quora.com/How-is-web-crawling-used-in-data-science-1/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,11,–,www.quora.com,How-is-web-crawling-used-in-data-science-1,"This is where it starts.
Data Science starts with Data, and that data comes from the web. On web there are many services,online platforms, social networks and companies that bring people together. These people generate data by interacting, and creating.
The Science and Target area
Data science is science of these interactions, and the modeling of them to predict the future. This is where web crawling comes into picture. There are established algorithms that can be used to crawl the web and get the links of interest. After that the page under the link needs to be soraped. We will simply try to get the links of our interests by first targetting a site or domain.
Scraping and parsing
To scrape, the most common libraries ar Selenium, Beautiful soup, Requests and PhantomJS. There are specific parsers neceseeary to get the data in the form the next libraries can use. Notable parsers are, libxml, htmlparsers.
Traversing the Tree
The webpage is a tree with data at the leaf. The page has many tags and these tags have attributes. Xpath is preferred framework to traverse this tree and get the data. The browsers offer this xpath traversing option in the settings. Selenium, and BS support Xpath.
Storing the data
Dataset and SQLite library are very useful when it comes to storing the data to sql databases. The data is stored datatbase files, so they can serialized and stored on harddisks.
Doing Science
We have the data. After that, we can use libraries like Pandas and Numpy to clean the data for modeling. The science and analysis starts earlier as explained above.
Each step has its own problems, libraries that solve it and unique skillset. Skill that is required at all steps is imagination , and problem solving. If these two are mastered, then programming languages and its libraries will take care of the rest"
6,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-become-an-AI-expert-with-online-learning/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,24,–,www.quora.com,Can-I-become-an-AI-expert-with-online-learning,"Yes, you can become an expert at AI if you “learn” the following, irrespective of Online or Offline.
As you see, there is no AI involved to become in expert in AI. AI is a discipline that has been rapidly spreading because it is easy to get hold of data and computing power. Lets take a problem.
The above image is simplest image recognition problem. You give this image to a AI model and ask whether the line is going up or going down? AI model can be trained in such a way to find the line is first going down, and then up.
Let me share the points used in plotting the above curve (0,5), (1,1), (0,2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 5), (10,6)…
How will humans be able find whether the above points are going up / going down / going up and then down or the going down and then up?
Human has no figure, only the set of points. Think for a moment If you want computer to solve, then we should solve first, and the write a program to instruct computer on the solving process.
In order to become expert in AI and not just be one in a million, you need to really understand how the computer works with the data, mathematics, and problem solving. Unlike what many of the online classes are (Andrew Ng’s Youtube Videos and Joel Grus book are exeception) directly jumping into solving the problem using ML / AI models after courtesy introduction about the mathematics and computers. By following that, you can learn to use the data, feed the data to the sophisticated libraries and make final reports. You can still do Data science with Online Courses.
If you are thinking about becoming expert then you have to dive deeper into machinery involved in creating these libraries, and the underlying Math that makes the machinery run. There are resources, good problem solving training books, and very approachable books on mastering programming languages. The key is, the code in these books have to be understood, typed and then executed by yourself. You have to hack the code, and try breaking it to understand.
I started with the naive idea that learning Data Science is simple, and can be mastered with 3 months. Yes, I mastered the libraries. Joined online competition to solve the challenges in Data Science. Then it dawned on me, that it is about programming, mathematics and proficiency in problem solving. Every step of data science, you solve problems. Whether it is visualisation, model generation, model deployment or reporting. (I did not touch about model explainability, that is another interesting area)
Solid Time commitment is required for master the Data Science Machinery and underlying Math. Time allocated for reading problems, solving problems and then writing code has to be the highest. You can learn new concepts and immediately take some real problems and solve it. If not create a fictional one with data and solve it.
Have a great climb to expert level in AI. It is a worthy pursuit. All the very best."
7,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-control-your-hornyness-when-it-is-not-the-time-to-be-horny/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,7,–,www.quora.com,How-do-you-control-your-hornyness-when-it-is-not-the-time-to-be-horny,"Disclaimer: Use this advice on your own judgement. Depending on your age, and level of maturity the content will either enlighten you, or make you confused.
It is not strange that there is no answer for this question.
The solution to your issue is simple. Masturbate. It is acceptable to Masturbate (With love and care and ensure no damage occurs)
When you are horny, either Testosterone or Estrogen, depending on your gender, are at high levels. These harmones reek havoc in your brain to such extent that, logical thinking collapses on its own weight. The imagery of having intercourse spontaneously gets created. The body starts feeling entirely strange. Voices of your loved ones, and their images flicker past your mind’s eye… Yep, all are the makings of these harmones….
The moment you release the “Rogue Harmones” from the body then the horny-ness vanishes. There goes the science of it. Now for some important things, which are non-sciency.
Depending on your age, the food you had, the people you have spoke with, things you have read and seen, everything affects the harmones that cause you to be horny. So try to learn about your body. Try to enjoy the act. Ensure you are not creating any skin damage in the process.
There are many religious and cultural taboos against Masturbation because, if you flog then you will not want to marry and have kids. If there are no kids then the religion or the culture will die. Be cautious about your belief systems. They are usually illogical.
Will my energy reduce?
There is no link between masturbation and how energetic you are. There are many movies, and books written about celebate priests or monks who abstain from the very act of human nature. None of these high priests or so called heroes discuss about their manly activity in the stories.
Will you become a Homo or Lesbian?
You can become a pro-wrestler or Pro-Pickup artist. It is in your hand. The human body and brains are wired in complicated ways, and this wiring can change as you age. You will still like to be with your opposite sex, have the urge to win, take responsibility and have a great life. More over, your partner will have confidence that, you are “Clean” when he are she comes close to you.
The advantages are really overwhelming. And there is no downside, except that your DNA is being wasted. For females the nature itself removes their egg every 28 days. For men as we are opposite to females, the release is in your own “Hands”. Have a great life ahead."
8,https://www.quora.com/Do-I-need-to-know-maths-to-have-a-skill-in-machine-learning/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,27,1,www.quora.com,Do-I-need-to-know-maths-to-have-a-skill-in-machine-learning,"Math is the language of this universe and the computer processors. If you want the Machine to learn, then only way is through math. There are many libraries that are developed to abstract away the math and let the user focus purely on getting insights, and gleaning wisdom from the data. All these libraries(Bento ML, Pycaret, SciKit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, StatsModel….) will give you garbage out, if you enter garbage in….
Yep. There is no short cut. Learning Math, and Logic is mandatory. However, math or Logic is not difficult if you learn from correct book or teacher with mindset to learn. Lets assume you did not listen to this advice and opened a apparel shop.
IN-SHOP APPAREL RECOMMENDER SYSTEM:
Your shop is prime location, and has good deal of customers around your locality. The customers are in few hundreds, lets assume. You want the shop to be futuristic, and have only limited man power(You believe humans have to design the apparels, and not stand in store waiting for customers). Based on customer past purchases you can do 3 things.
THE PROBLEM
How to build such a recommendation system with your shop’s customer data?
You decide to purchase a recommender system. The recommender system that you purchased has just the basic functionality. There is a python library called Surprise, that can be used after learning from data and recommend. The recommender system just takes the data into the Library, then it gets ready to recommend apparels to your customer. You are surprised!!!
In your store, you have a camera which is used to identify the customer who has entered the store (Deep learning Computer vision model) and then automatically triggers the recommender program. On the wall there is a display which shows and vocalizes
“”” Welcome Back <Customer Name> ^_^”””
and then proceeds to recommend some of the apparels the customer might like, on the store display. Customer is surprised to be welcomed by SHOP and even to be suggested apparels!!!. Customer starts walking around the shop, and browses the materials. Lets assume for fun, the customer is a pregnant women and she is looking for some loose fitting cloth. Her age is 28. Now the joke starts…
The Shop display starts showing some tight jeans, and skinny T shirts that are trendy among the 28 year young females. The recommender system that is developed without the knowledge of Maths / Coding, and how to incorporate new information into the data, cannot consider the fact that the customer is “PREGNANT”. Recommender system cannot logically find that pregnant women cannot use tight jeans. Recommendation fails!!! Customer leaves your SHOP, ANGRY and Nostalgic about her care free days… Not a pretty outcome.
“””This case of wrong recommendations continues with new variants for another 10 customers”””
By that time, you realize the recommender system is junk because is not getting the data to recommend accurately. So, you decide learn about the data inside it and how it works. The code for the recommender system is directly downloaded from the product website. So you visit the website. There you find their code repository open for the users to review, modify and learn…. (This is the future, so get ready)
The LOGIC Correction
The code is written in languages that are popular for such systems, Python, R and frontend is written in Javascript and HTML Libraries. When you read the code, you realize the level of math that is being used is rather basic. There are clear comments about why some function is being called, and what is the logic behind the function. Bit more complicated functions are directly imported from the libraries elsewhere in the internet. The more you read the code, you start getting idea how to improve your recommender system. (Here you realize the impact of math and logic)
Your WITTY RECOMMENDER
After some 10 hours of working, you have coded some additional logic into the recommender system and sent it to the code reviewer to check it. The reviewer finds some issues and suggests to edit the logic. Another 5 hours or so this goes back and forth and finally your recommender system is ready. When you deploy the system, based on your shop’s customer the recommender works and the customers are kept engaged, and delighted. You even made your recommender witty, by making it to tell jokes about the recommender systems that suggest tight jeans for pregnant ladies….
So math is very important, and understanding libraries at a deeper logic level will give you more power, and creativity. There are couple of books that introduces doing math with programming language. Search “Doing Math with Python / R/ Javascript” in Google, you will find countless books. Learn the concepts, and understand how to program math to computers. The code in the books that you choose, needs to be typed by yourself and executed to understand. Then you can fluently learn about the libraries that do the real Machine learning.
Have a great time learning. Reachout to google, stackexchange or here for clarifying and researching your doubts."

NN does the modelling of your networks differently.
Neural nets can help you to analyse the data in many dimension, even the dimension your “gut feeling” will consider and your brain cannot. Our brain is strictly rooted in the present 3D world. It is difficult for it to visualise higher dimensions and try categorising things as per these dimensions. Try thinking of a problem that is time and space dependent, it becomes very difficult visualise without practice.
For example, If I ask you, why you like people with green eyes, or face with a particular shape or voice of particular pitch for that matter(Remember that irritating voice that makes you angry or restless). Your brain cannot answer, since there is no numerical rating for these characteristics. Brain cannot create a model. But neural nets can take these into account and model your social networks. I am only scratching the surface of what can be done.
There are other simple math relations you can find using Network Analysis. Here neural nets are not involved.
I had the same question that you asked before 12 months, and I started learning neural nets very deeply. Recent advances in Neural nets are very fascinating. If you don't understand, then it will feel like magic. There are huge libraries of programs that support modelling the social networks and other kind of networks. Please research and learn about it."

There is really no need for Machine learning. You can program the camera module for example, a surface scratch defect. The module will work flawlessly, and detect only some kind of scratches.
If some new defect arises, then the whole process needs to done and camera module reprogrammed. This can be avoided.
Where Machine learning can excel is in applications where we humans know some thing is defective, but programming it is cumbersome and repetitive. Machine Learning, literally automates such repetetive programming. The variant is neural network called Convulutional NN that excel at learnin such defects and successfully classify the new defects.
There are many deep NN that can differentiate, dogs from cats and even differentiate dog breeds. So the defects are like that only. The more training samples you have better the training and validation accuracy will be. The ML solutions can speed up the basic classification, and instead of using more manpower, one operator can do the final checkin of the defect.
I have not even scratched the surface of ML. It is just a no theory intro of ML.
Explore more and you will find a lot of research is going on in this area. Have a great time."

When you are from testing background you will catch many of the libraries and algorithms very easily. So, Go ahead learn DS. But learn on your own, with intention to skill up. Not to change career.
Why not change carrier? Let me convince you that, your own domain has more opportunity, if you look.
You can learn DS and then look at your domain problems. The more you look in any domain there are areas where data is generated. Say, you want to know how many tests you are currently running. That depends on the number of projects, resources under you, and their profeciency. You must have a dashboard showing that.
There are just three dimensions. What can you do to increase the speed of your tests? Hmm, that needs analysis. You might find that relationship between profeciency and speed is less, but with increased number of resources the speed is more. How you prove this? Data Science.
There could be countless locations where inefficiencies will be there in your organisation. You can collect data, analyse and show these areas. Once you do that, you will realise that you are able to lead better, convince people easily and get things done fast. No wonder you will start liking what you are doing. This happens not just at work, but at home too.
Learn data science and use the skill to contribute. If good opportunity comes use it. Shifting job alone cannot be a good motivator. Have a wonderful career."

Here is what you can do…. You have to complete 4 books and master the way of programming, documenting, testing and deploying. Once you complete and get confident, please share it with your friends or family members so they too can learn programming. Programming is an important skill in this complicated world. Lets dive in…
>> You will have to learn about to Jupyter notebooks, Regular Expressions and get introduced to SQL, HTML etc in coming steps. So the learning curve will be steep. Like KTM Duke / Yamaha RX 100 accelerating…
>> Test driven development is same as In-process quality testing in Mechanical Industry. (I am from manufacturing and mechanical background) If you remember the assembly lines where operators can stop the lines if there is defect. Software industry uses that idea efficiently and built lot of libraries around it. You will catch it very easily.
4. Lets level up a bit. Search for books that provide programming challenges that are more about problem solving through coding. Here too select a book which introduces you to problems that are easy to start, and slowly builds up challenge.
5. Solve the problem, Code the challenges, and then upload the code file to GitHub.
The above steps can take anywhere between 30 days to 90 days depending on your speed of understanding, problem solving and typing speed. I am considering that you are interested in sitting with the laptop all day long (14 to 16 hours). If you are working, then give additional 3 months time to master these steps.
These steps helps you to
Once you equip with these skills, you will understand many things that happen in the Software Industry. Also, you can confidently choose any software project you want, and approach it with confidence, and clarity that you will complete it.
Yeah, getting the job interview might be still tough, but after learning the above skills, you might even decide to go freelancing, or approach the job hunting differently. All the very best."

Listen.
Listen without thinking to answer.
Listen with intention to clarify.
Listen with your eyes.
Finally ask for clarifying question before you answer.
When possible be kind to the other person and ask them whether they have any questions after you finish answering.
(Language barriers are reduced not by learning new languages to speak, but to listen to new friends, colleagues)

ML can work only on data that is fed. It cannot create new data or experiment. Some flavours of Reinforced learning can do experiments and learn, it is still not methodical experimentation. Allow me to elaborate.
Causal relationships are like laws of this universe. Starting from newtons laws of motion, Laws of thermodynamics, Energy conservation laws.
We have an age old wisdom that is,
Correlation does not imply Causation.
To imply Causation, lot of parallel study in unrelated feilds will be required. The physical experiments, the theory behind the causation needs to be verified mathematically. Many such discoveries yeild noble prize. We should also remember the creativity and meticulous work of scientists in finding such causation. Even then, many findings in the past were just correlation.
Machine Learning is purely mathematical. The universe it works is very different from our reality. The number of dimensions in some ML problems can go in hundreds of dimensions. But they are conceptual dimensions. Not something you can physically see or feel.
With help of libraries written in programming languages that can handle huge data, the theory behind the Machine learning is abstracted. Thanks to object oriented programming, it is much easier to abstract the machinery. If not today ML will be in obscurity.
With machine learning a new law or causation cannot be discovered, but only learned. The causation will be learnt using equations, variables and their outputs. They cannot be proved using more mathematics. But the outputs will have sufficient accuracy so we can make decision or influence someone."

Before there was Statistics. Statistics is very misleading when the data is not sufficient. You have countless books explaining how statistics can be misleading. AI and DS leverages on Statistics, and solves problems and does it so well. But do we need it??? You will find out, keep reading
If you need one skill to then it is Problem Solving. There are many aspects to problem solving.
AI and DS started flourishing because the data availability sky rocketed along with the Computational power. Consider the datapoint.
How can these 5 points determine whether the company will default on the loan? In past, there will be no way to find out, apart from lot of calculation, years of experience and finally taking risk and extending credit. Finally see if the company repays it. That was a problem to banks. Today, the problem is solved (atleast 97%), to an extent that it is possible to predict the default ahead of time.
The Key is PREDICT. AI and DS are used extensively to predict the outcomes. They are used to locate the correlations, that our naked eyes or paper pencil calculations cannot show. All you need is the creativity and intuition to predict what might happen next.
Programming, Math are just tools. If you can predict or if your intuition says something will happen, then you use programming to collect the data and math to work on the data to PROVE you are correct. This is a very powerful ability. Leaders and effective managers use data so skillfully to influence the world around them.
Visualise yourself sitting in a meeting with a potential partner, and he is sharing you the benefits of a investment Scheme. As he continues to explain, your intuition says is there some flaw in the investment opportunity. You are unable to find it out. What you do next? Go to Google and ask for reviews from other users, or directly ask for the pro and cons of the investment scheme. Here you are trying to predict what will happen if you choose the scheme. You solved the problem, correct?
If you want others also to solve the problem, or if you want to solve the same problem with different values, conditions, and time lines then you can automate the process by programming it. The steps you take manually can be programmed simply using any programming language, say python and execute the below PSEUDOCODE.
Each step above needs many steps, and many problems to solve. You have to imagine what you need as end result and walk back towards the current situation. Many things like programming, libraries, databases knowledge might be required, or you can hire someone to do it for you. Again, you can solve the problem that you have.
It is acceptable to be unaware of something and be weak in it. It is unacceptable to be weak after you know how to master a skill. All it takes to learn problem solving and programming is the passion to solve problems and create change in your own life and that of others.
There are so many free resources that is offered by many online Problem solving websites, that you can learn from. Many programming languages can be compiled on the websites. The data is available freely if you search in in Google. Change your mindset and start solving problems. Solve easy ones and gain confidence, then move to difficult ones. There are books which curate problems from easy to difficult levels. Search for them, and you will get it.
Have a great life and wonderful time learning to solve problems."

You need to major is physics, computer science and mathematics, specifically geared towards making emergent systems. That is just the start. Or you have to hire such people and pay them to work on creating the AGI. That is what Musk is doing, in Neuralink and OpenAi.
If you get to AGI,then you may have to let the AGI run your company… Hmm, interesting situation, rite? Think about it. Musk is alread fighting that such level of AI should not be created. Musk is a physics major too.
An AGI has to be connected with multiple AGI in order to show emergent behaviour. Then only AGI can become conscious. Because physicists have proved consciousness is a cause of an emergent system, our brain.

Think this way. when a simulated world grows to level were that world can create its own simulation, then Recursion happens. Godel has written a lot on this idea. Take a look at his writings. Trippy, yet very gripping
With the advent of quantum computing, finding the matters that are why smaller that, a huge collider is required, the march towards metaverse, all these tech can help in creating a man made simulation. Which means, simulation inside the simulation. Recurrsion.
You must be aware of recurssion in programming, that is a function calling itself is a recursive function. If the argument given that function is very large then the system will run out of memory. If ours is a simulated world and we create a full fledged simulation, then there is possibility that our simulated beings to can create simulation. (Godel can be of help here, the math is complex). Then the main system running the program will run out of memory. And the designer of the system is lousy.
Lets assume a situation where an AI has already made paper clips out of the entire universe and a made a powerful computer to run simulations to gather data on something much bigger than this universe that this AI wants to control. Will the AI allow such recurrsion in its system, even accidentally. Will AI be a lousy programmer. Very less probability, that the null hypothesis can be safely rejected
So be assured, the world we live is not simulated. My views might change as the metaverse that many are touting really becomes simulated universe with creatures that can replicate itself by using the system resources differently, and there is a lot of “Deja vu” happening for lot more people then we might have to seriourly consider the possibility that we are just simulated beings.

When I say solutions, I need to come up with solution, code them and then find my answer is wrong. Like this 5 times if it happens, then I look at the logic. What I gain in that five times is more important.
After 5 different trials, if no correct solution then,
Here are some actions that can be taken to mitigate above challenges.
Misunderstanding the problem statement is very common. Nowadays, the online judges are having good descriptive questions, and sample cases for you to understand. So try honing your information gathering skill.
Not knowing the capabilities of the programming language, can arise due to forgetting the feature, or completely unaware of a feature. For example, in python there is a standard dict type that is part of python and default dict type that you can import from collections library.
This knowledge about defaultdict can greatly change the way you solve a problem. Start documenting the important functions, and programs and refer them regularly. Build your own Cheatsheet
Finally, solving a problems is series of decisions. When you chose a variable to be a integers, and list of integers can completely change how you access them. If your problem is designed for a list type and looping method, then doing it any other way might be tedious. Here again comes, documenting again but more detailed one.
You need full working programs to be documented. So learn Git, Github and store your programs there. Wherever you are, you must be able to get hold of the program that you want.
Most important use online judges and problems given there to train. There is still a challenge of which problems to start with. One of the judges I know have their own guide and hours of training session for free. That too online. All you need is spend time and learn.
Have a great time and all the very best."

It is the illusion created by the human mind and humans are living in illusion. For instance, in the infancy stage, humans don't have any urge to reproduce. Humans grow up without being aware of the sex hormones slowly taking over the control of their feelings and their mind. Then the uncontrollable urge causes discomfort in their bodies and in order to relieve themselves of that discomfort, the humans do the act of reproduction. Who is then driving humans to reproduce? It is the DNA residing inside the human body that is driving the body through urge to reproduce. It is the DNA that has built the body around itself for its purpose and made the body ignorant of DNA’s presence that is causing the body to think that it (i.e. the body) is controlling everything and taking action as per body’s own sweet will. Thus, the body and the mind are thinking and doing everything under illusion. So, the mind should shake off its illusion and think that it is the DNA inside it that is coercing it to reproduce and the mind should not give away easily itself to the DNA’s tantrums. Only then, the mindless reproduction will stop. In some people the DNA made errors while building their bodies and in such defective bodies, DNA is unable to cause the urge to reproduce and such people are liberated from the mindless reproduction. Remember Osho’s famous slogan, “If the child is beautiful, so is the act that produced it.”.

Yep, they do have rivals, competitors or industry threats… Google’s major products are it Search, Android OS, Youtube service and their Keyword ad services. Lets make this analysis more interesting by doing the Porter’s 5 forces analysis
New entrant threats : MAAN companies and Googles IPs will make this threat non-existent
Substitituition : Search, Youtube and Android have costlier substitutes, so the risk is low. Amazon Search can be a good substituition though.
Buyers Bargaining Power: Limited power since the algorithms at Google consider the power and price the service accordingly
Sellers Bargaining Power: Google is horizontally and vertically integrated. Their major supplier are Software engineers, Government for land, sea and electricity. The Government can be a strong Seller, with immense Bargaining Power
Industry Rivalry : Rivalry among the MAANG will not be a news those following the media, reading books about these companies. These players, are very logical and leisez faire kind of Rivals.
Some additional snippets:
As of 2017 much of the search for the theoretical and knowledge oriented products were done on Google, while the real money to businesses that makes products depend on AMAZON. Product searches are done on Amazon directly.
If any of the MAAN companies become very big, and decide to take on the core “Search” product of Google, then Google may go bankrupt.
How Challenging can taking on just the Search product can be?
Search product and its algorithms, the pagerank, keyword auction, ad display algorithms are the back bone of the Behemoth called Google.
To addon, Google has hardware network in place to take their traffic to remote corners of the world, like the T1 lines, huge numbers of data centers, companies acquired which have both computing and networking prowess.
Search is integrated in the Android phones which may come in countless flavours, but these phones use google api, services in the backend and give back the data to the Queen bee (or King bee).
When I was thinking about the everything I do in my work, there is some involvement of Google. Unlike Amzn, FB or Apple, which are just “Good to have”, not a MUST HAVE. Google is a MUST HAVE.
Will the world of Searchers be ready to pay for their Search?
Worst calamity occurs, and Google is brought down to its knees. It is unable to deliver search results or youtube videos, or other countless services. They ask for the world of “Searcher” to give/ lend/ purchase share of 1$, (or denominations of that amount). Considering only the adults in this world, who are above 15 year of age, that amount to 5.9 Billion. They will get 5.9 Billion USD in less than 24 hours, and become afloat again.
The odds of google going under and then staying under is 1 in a hunderd trillion kind. In other words it is very unlikely. So stay calm, and keep searching. (I am telling this to myself too and keep my 1$ saved for Google).
Edit in Evening:
The odds of Google going Bankrupt or taken over has increased to 1 in billion kind
There is surprising Contender for Google Search Product, and that is Open AI’s GPT3. Anyone thinking about super charging your search, then better look at that AI model. It is amazing…."

Since you are new to the corporate world, stay away from anyone you might like in office, even they may be attractive and attracted to you.
Why? Work place is not for emotional attachment. It is place of vision, execution and effeciency. All these require Logic. If you are not fully invested then your mind won't work logically and creatively. The moment you bring attachment, your brain will seize up. Instead of being attached to the vision of the team or organisation,your brain will think about the person you are attached with. Your career will slow down, and if not careful, even END.
How? How to find a mate for a date? Simplest of the option, don't Search. Be attractive enough by mind and soul, your partner will come to you. Just do what you like the most, and there you will find your partner waiting. Think about it.
Not many go to work by liking it. In workplace you will find partners who are equally distracted and disoriented. You might find them physically attractive but get bored soon after you know them.
What next? Be greatful you have a workplace and monthly salary. Think about investing in yourself and get ready for a wonderful life. Think about going to cities, mountains that are beautiful and adventurous. Make plan for your dream home, that feeling of being in control over life. Read up. Read up as many books you want on any subject. Exercise and keep your body, brain and back strong, you will need it when your partner comes in your life.
Remember, you will attract exactly the people you want and think about. Be clear who you want, how they should be, what they look like and how will they treat you. You will be surprised. when they materialise in front of you and care for you. In that moment, make sure you decide wisely and stay with that partner for life.

AI simulations of the game worlds are itself very difficult because, the agent(the AI program) has limited visibility, and the feedback for Agent’s actions is delayed for long time.

Then wear the coder hat, and code the solution and test it.

Self Hypnosis and Reinforcement learning or completely opposite.
Self hyopnosis is a process of believing that a particular activity or behaviour can expressed by a “self”.
Reinforced learning gives positive feedback to an agent when it achieves a goal or completes an activity. If it doesn’t achieve then it is penalised. It is more akin to pleasure/ pain learning mechanism that many self help books suggest to learn a habit.
Humans learn in multiple ways, and one of them is reinforced learning. Belief system involves memory, forecasting, mirroring and mimicing, which is not fully done by Reinforced learning alone.
When Deep learning GANs and Reinforcement learning are modeled together then some level of imagination, attention can be found, but it is all mathematics. Not something equivalent to human consciousness or cognition.
Consciousness and cognition is an emergent behaviour. So is self hypnosis. If multiple agents can learn by reinforcement and communicate with each other and the environment, then self hypnosis can be modeled. But mathematically modelling it will need much research and computation power.

I can share what I am doing now, and see if that makes sense to you.
Take up Python really serious, and learn it the hard way.
TYPE EVERY LINE OF CODE
Meaning, to do very simple to hard programming challenges by typing and executing. Because that is what a SW / ML / AI engineer does. He or she has to work with, using the language he knows with real world data, that is incomplete, messy and sometime obnoxious (quora comment, anybody!!!).
Here are some basic activities. Search for programming challenges for these activities.
BASICS:
General Variables
Input checking
Logic Flow
Functions
Repetition using loops
String Manipulation and selection
Database access and data structure usage
Web scraping and data collection
Accessing APIs
These are very basic but when you try programming with language you know, you will see that these challenges are worth it. You can search Google for “Programming Challenges”. Choose only those challenges, that help you master the language. Don’t take the “Puzzles and Problem solving challenges”. You will get easily discouraged…. That come later, you can do it now for fun!!!
REDO with GUI
After completing the programming challenges, redo these challenges by creating some of GUI for these challenges. In case of Python, TKInter or Flask is very predominant libraries to look into.
As you are familiarising yourself, you can also look for resources to “Learn Python/ Javascript/ Ruby the hard way”. Meaning, to type every line of code yourself. Then upload the code to your GITHUB repo. (You have to learn GIT, I found it intuitive)
Master Probability & Stats for Data Analysis
Another subject to master in parallel is Probability, Hypothesis and Inference in Statistics.
There are many statistical tests , data analysis heuristics that can tell you about the data, without you having to search the complete data. This is a skill which ML / AI engineers really excel at. So I am currently searching and learning these skills. Another important skill is, ability to convert your ideas into Python code. This will need practice… Typing… Executing… Repeat…
SOURCING YOUR DATA
There are lot of data sources out there. The real ML engineer can source his own data, with Style in Python. There are very good libraries in Python, but I prefer Selenium for JS enabled sites, and BeautifulSoup for regular requests site.
There is whole lot of learning, practicing, typing code, helping others to learn, typing more code, scraping most of the code when I find a simple library to do it, and the cycle repeats…
WHY DATASCIENCE IS REWARDING?
Datascience, ML Jobs are touted to be the most rewarding, because the daily tasks feels like playing games. You set yourself a particular goal, and you go after it, in REAL WORLD. Real World is messy, so you need to practice a lot to get the data from real world, make sense of it, make a model from it, and then present it as “Gold/silver/platinum level Model” to the company you work for.
Like how the “Gold Mining” was done during Wild West days, yep that is the exact analogy that suits for ML/ AI engineer too. There are many “Good Bad and Uglies” out there. The journey to get the reward is more rewarding than the reward itself.
READY FOR THE TREKKING/ MOUNTAINEERING???
So, if you are ready to take the journey (Up hill trekking/ mountain climbing) with your bare fingers typing away on the keyboard for 13 to 14 hours a day, eye burning after staring the monitor, back aching after trying to execute the code that breaks due to some silly logic errors, and much more…. then and only then START.
Once you take the 1st STEP… look up, look forward and IMAGINE and KEEP SEARCHING like a Scientist, an Engineer. We will reach… See you at the TOP"

Database access and data structure usage
Web scraping and data collection

There are websites that host the models of neural networks that has been already trained with huge datasets.There are Git repos that host these models too.
Search in Github. Then there is Dagshub that host both data and the models together.
If you are looking for some cloud service that can allow you to program the neural networks, and then get the trained model out of that service and use it in productiion, then you need to search in the internet.
I can provide you the search terms only (Providing the service names is considered as promotion in Quora) Some tems to search for are,
Cloud notebooks for python programming
Programming python on cloud servers
Neural network (Computer vision, Language) models. Also the keras library and spacy library comes with some builtin models.
Free jupyter notebooks on cloud.
These could lead you to the service that you are looking for. Have a fun time. Take as much you want, then give back once you have learnt and mastered from the internet."

The DS is expected to have good coding and data acquisition skills. If you want to enter a good company which values the skill of ML then the base is important.
Apart from that by learning to code and acouire data, you don't need to join a company, you can create your own campany. How do you think FB got created, or for that matter any of the ML companies you are aspiring to be part of?
The guys at the top have good business and coding skills, and importantly they can hack the system so they can try out their ideas fast and automated way. All this requires coding. More you can speak the Language of the Machine the more easier is to get the ML work that is rewarding.
Deep learning is much easier to learn but to code it and get the data to it for processing would be trouble if you can’t code.

In the beginning, you can use forums like Google, Stackoverflow to get support for the errors you get. In stackoverflow, you can share the complete code and ask support on the error. Pls research before asking.
For long term the solution is to read lot of good code and try to understand how it is written. Then type it out to run it yourself. Chk whether you are able to run the code succesfully. This exercise will show you new ways to debug the code. Also it will show if you are making some typo or programming syntax errors.
One tried rethod is to read the code from bottom to top, aloud. Yep, like a child learning english. You will resolve many syntax and typo errors that way.
Always type the code. Most of the time the white spaces, and tabs can create problems which propagate to many errors.
Use an IDE. This will reduce the time you spend searching the errors.
Precisely, You use the computer to help you debug. Once you can do that, then programming is fun. You can then take repetetive problems you have and try to solve them, by programming."

37,https://www.quora.com/What-is-machine-learning-with-an-example/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,43,–,www.quora.com,What-is-machine-learning-with-an-example,"Based on your series of questions regarding ML(Machine Learnin) following is a crisp answer clarifying all the areas of doubt.
ML is a process of finding realation among the variables in the data and then use that relation to predict the unknown variables in related dataset. Relation is found in Training data set, and it is validated in test dataset. Then the relation(called a model) is deployed in field.
Examples include predicting the demand of the online store, classifying a comment is toxic or good. Summarising the topic of the document using NLP. Finding the subject in a picture. All this examples have the common starting point. Numbers. Whatever the data, the machine can read numbers only. The work of ML engineer is partly to know how to convert the data into numbers.
To reiterate, whether a picture, word or general number is converted to number format the algorithms can read and provide answers. Again the answers are in Numbers. ML engineer has to feed the data in correct format and then interpret the answer that comes out of the functions.
ML engineer has to work with data that is stored in many places, like databases, documents, websites, APIs etc. They program a lot of functions that automate the data feeding and interpretation process. Then there are pipelines in production code that needs the models for real time processing. This is also done by ML engineer.
Programming Language used is Python. There are countlesss resources out there to pickup and learn this language. You must attain fluency with reading the code others have written and underrtand what it does. Later you can start writing. Try using IDE like pycharm or VScode for running the code snippets.
If you are planning to learn ML there is involvement of Mathematics. This part of ML is mostly abstracted by libraries like Scipy. Numpy, Scikit learn and importantly pycaret. So be calm and try to get some hands on in working on the data first. Slowly the math can be learnt.
Happy Learning."

ax + b = c is an age old line equation. Where a, b are the parameters. The addition of the terms on left side is the “algorithm”. There can be many complicated methods to fit the data. Also there can be many parameters, in ML they are called features.
With this simple equation, you might think, it impossible to create all this amazing results. You are correct. The idea is simple, but the work that goes into it is very intensive.
A model store the parameters, structure and the associated values. This is same for ML or deep learning model. The libraries in python for deep learning can be very confusing to begin with. Using the simple algebra equation model, you can easily understand many complex receipes.

Alpha Numerical based
Natural language based
Computer vision based
All the options will require data. So your project will spend more time on collecting data. Then you may want to annotate the data, if you are going to do supervised learning.
The domain you choose are huge currently. You can think about real world applications that are currently having ineffective solutions. Then using ML try solving it.
The industry that is ripe is Social studies and sciences. There is lot of activities that the govt takes. Recently, IT dept of India decided to open past tax returns filings based on an ML algorithm. Most probably, it is a supervised classification algorithm.
Then the engineering feild needs to be researched where the data can be used for finding good solutions. There is many opportunity in optimisation problems in production, design and reliability.

Python and Javascript (You can learn C++ too)
Work on problem solving (Real world is full of problems, but to learn problem solving. you need to spend time with toy prblems first, theo imagin how the problems can be seen real world)
Discipline and Energetic mindset.(This is cultnvated by regularly doing things and activities that are difficult to you)
Mathematics(The language of this universe has to be learned and visualised. Spend your evenings with hot chocnate and good math book)
Lots of good Sci fiction. The ideas of many science fiction books have been made a reality. In fact AI was spoken by authors before the scentists came up with math and tech for AI.
Work on seeing the world as data. This is really an ability. The more you can think about the world as data, the more you can find interesting problems to solve. Whether a website or a mobile app, it is data. The code is also data. The infrastructure is also data.
Database and distributed computing. This will be an important technology to hold the data and process it.

I loved the way the book takes you to places that you can not imagine going to. I read 5 book from this author after that. I became a voracious Reader from that point.
The next book that pulled me was Dan Brown´s Angels and demons. Something spell binding in the way Dan uses the words to describe the places, plots, people and situation. His books transport you to a different Realm of the story.
My love for fiction was at the top when I read Sherlock Holmes by AC Doyle. ACD’s books are about the plots, the logic and the use of human brain to its peak ability. Sherlock is a person who is based on once living doctor.
Then comes the giants of Sci fi. Issac asimov, Arthur C clarke and Neal stephenson books. Their works mix, places, logic, Sci Fi know how, math, artificial intelligenc, culture and bring out a very nuanced experience that can be enjoyed only by reading them. These three authors can make you to fall in love with reading very easily.
Walter issacson has written biography of many notable founders. The probing narrative that he weaves around the lives of his subjects can bring them alive in your imagination.
Brian Tracy has some good self help books that you want to learn on self improvement. Countless Dale carnegie books too can make you read and at the same time improve.
Try the books. There is a saying that book chooses you. In that sense Robert green’s collection of books are a present as hard copies in my library. If you are ever curious about human nature then his books will give you a very in depth research which is vrey much readable.
There is Charles Dickens, Ian flemmig, Roald dahl and Rudyard kipling. Their books are introduced to children so they can get interested in reading. Try their works if yoo are inclined about enjoyable reads.

It encapsulates the entire world you live in today. The world did not change, the way information flowed, changed drastically. The population of humans increased as info flowed freely.
What to do with all this information flowing all across the world? Much of the info couldn't be stored in digital format cheaply even in late 2010. The turning point ocurred when the technology to commoditize the hard disk and processors where born.
From then the information started flowing faster and became cheaper to save. This cheaper data storage means, a lot of data which previously considered useless got saved somewhere, and that too cheaply and reliably.
Why am I telling the story of information when the question is about Machine Learning?
ML distills the informtion into actionable insights that can be used to make predictions about the future. Data analysis helps to see what the ML is doing visually. Data analysis is used for many generic tasks too, but when you use it with ML, the power to understand the ML model increases.
With all the info available, it is important that any one thinking about ML must be ready to work with lot of data and fluently move between the various data streams using the programming.
Why learning Data Structures and Algorithm is important, but not really a show stopper?
The data in real world is messy. If you want to access it,then you need to solve the problem. There comes the DS and Algo. It is not a show stopper because most of the extractions you have to do can be learned thru google, cookbooks and pair programming friends.

You have to learn programming and problem solving too. Learning it thru gamified platform like leetcode, hackerrank will give you lot of confidence and you can see others solving the problems bettter than you, and get inspired or get charged to beat them.
Logic and probability. AI is extremely logical and involves stochastic probability. These may sound difficult, the trick is in solving many problems so these concepts become second nature to your left and right brain. The sync of left and the right brain is trainable. Takes a considerable time when you become old. When you are young the time spent on TV and watching television has to be used for this.

There they are even with their struggles, going towards a purpose,an idea that they think will bring a change in life or keep their life from falling apart. Some positive thinking, among the relentless negativity that surrounds each one.
Those who smile and look at the world for inspiration, motivation and calmness they will get it. First smile at yourself.

Before that…
Project you need to do is,
Watch a lot of videos on mathematical problem solving and document the type of problems and their solutions.
Play lot of video games that have AI characters. Halo series and portal series are very interesting. There is invisible by Klei, Mass effect series, and Guardians of galaxy. Your imagination has to be primed first.
Read up the Robot series and Foundation series by issac Asimov. Any AI or Robot developer should dip into the contribution of Asimov(You will understand why Elon Musk decided to Colonise Mars)
Solve lot of puzzles and again document the interesting solutions.
As a side project follow couple of important companies Deep mind, Open Ai, Two minute papers etc…
You will come up with lot of project ideas and problems to solve once you do the above. Then what?
Python language is your go to choice. There are ways to learn this language visually. Any thing you learn needs to useful in this world. It can break the world or make the world, but it needs to do something. You need to visualise the solution first.
That is why I ask to play games. They help to visualise the solution. Games have immense impact on your imagination. AI needs lot of imagination and visualisation to understand and then use it creatively.
Next take the programs written by others, copy it in VSCode (the best IDE out there, all hackers and programmers use it, and it is super easy) and try to execute and check the output. You can get lot of books and courses apart from those thought at school. Read the books like a novel. Apply the programs and try to visualise what kind of solution the author of the book has preferred. Document the ideas.
Visualise what the computer did to get that output. I repeat this. This is important because computer will follow set of rules to solve a problem. You need to work with that rules. This takes visualising, time, practice, taking ideas from others and sharing new ideas.
This is the best part of learning to program and working with AI. You spend so much time trying to understand your computer, that you can find ways to make it think for itself. Even though it is thinking in numbers.
Remember Visualising is a big part in AI and programming. Have a great future. Take one step at a time."

There are countless claims on how AI has helped to creat the future. I have a simple and logical reason. AI lets you to visualise the impact of a random factor on a particular outcome.
Take an example of Car. We all have travelled in it. Recently with Uber and Ola the number of people who could travel increased drastically. instead of owning a car, renting a car is making more sense atleast in some cities. This was possible because the location of the cab and the rider could be automatically linked.
If it needs to be done in traditonal rule based programming then the lines of code required will be very large. For every product which needs connectivity with the customer the code needs to be repeated. All this repetition has been removed by AI abstraction.
Still there is lot of code, but now anybody can use it replicate their own product. This is a phenomenal change in how the world works and coding is done. This is possible only becaure of notonly AI but the entire ecosystem that formed around it.
Then there is Data. Today the Code itself has become data. The way the syntax and the algorithm is implemented can be seen as a pattern by the AI neural nets. Without that AI cannot be useful. Even the power of computing will not be able to surpass the importance of the Data. Unlike computing a scarce resource the Data is created evert second.
With the data, the pattern matching and the rule generation in programming is automated. To answer your question, that is why AI and so called “future” is here today. Use it to live and code happily."

then begin by listing the steps for doing the activity.
you will start seeing some activities have dependencies, others you have no knowledge, still others that can be done by using some form of physical mecahanisms.
The above three steps art the problem identification stage. There are couple of steps more before you can start typing on your keyboard.The data structure and mechanism to collect data is decided. The algorithm to process is decided. All these steps are like solving puzzles.
Then you use the programming language that you know to code.
The order of learning to code starts by not learning to code but to sit and solve problems. Then try solving them differently with the data structures and algorithms others have used. Follow that by reading lots and lots of code written by others and identifying how they solved the problems.

If you are young then better go to college, there are other benefits of being with likeminded guys and girls. That part of your life is a gift to cherish. Now I am done with that so getting down to business…
The college provides you all the necessary courses, and provides you exam and teachers to train you. When you do it yourself then, you have to find alternate for the teachers, exams and a way to train.
Teachers are easy to replace. Online courses give you the necessary teachers. Exam is also easy to replace by attending the certification exams or online examination sites.
Way to train is most difficult to replace. Training means not just repeating what is in the book or course. It means able to use your knowledge in real life scenario. This takes lot of effort and time. This effort you will put in college too, but there you will be paying for doing it. Here you will do it with WILL power.
Then there is the material that you train on. This is another challenge that you will encounter. This can be sorted out by exploring both online and offline books stores and libraries. I prefer http://z-librar

The idea that creative people need to be famous is another challenge this “getting things done” society has gotten us into. Many creative guys start many projects and abandon them if they are not interested. They are very specific in using their time differently.

After 12 months of practice, completing all the kaggle courses, see the outcome below. You can see the associated kaggle notebook, here
The charts shows the story, and it was possible by python, and kaggle notebook. Before this 12 month of practice, I was also lost for 2 years….
So what clicked???
The solution is simple. Head to Kaggle courses page and start one course at a time. No pressure.. Go steadily and learn the chapters, and enjoy the following code exercises and getting simple answers first. You have to spend time in figuring out the correct answers, before you check their hints and solutions. (Avoid the urge to complete the exercises and move forward, I did that the first time and got lost completely)
You have to read up on the related books on the course. For example, the intro course is on Python. When you complete the course, take Python for dummies kind of book and go thru it. You will see some points you learnt in the course come in the book and explained with new example.
When you do this, you will start connecting the dots and start trying out new things with python. Then move to the next course. Do the same. Give Yourself 3 months to finish the courses. Steadily, you will start understanding the Language and the Platform. Imagination is the key here. Thinking how the concepts you are learning can be applied in real world problems, as you go through the courses is important.
If you are wondering where to get all the books, then head to Z-Library. The world's largest ebook library.
This site has every book that a aspiring teenager needs. All you need is a smartphone with big screen, and good internet connectivity. I am sure, you have these two available.
By the end of 6 months you would have read atleast 100 different books and have done lot of exercises. You will have your fav books too. That point, you can look at related things like Git, software engineerig, Data structures and read more on them specifically. All this time you will be practicing it too.
This is the way to move forward, and as you see there is lot of practicing, reading and typing involved. To get through all this, you need to have the inspiration. Motivation will take you only to some distance, the rest is covered by your inner image of what you really want to become by using the coding skils.
For me Inspiration is Nikola Tesla, and the Warren Buffett. They have given their entire lives to find how certain aspect of this reality works, and shared it with the world. Whenever I find myself lost during the practice, or in the early morning feeling tired to wake up, it is the inspiration to share my findings, and knowledge that wakes me up.
The solution works and in process makes you confident, and creative. Able to provide answers, and ideas is very empowering. All the very best for your journey. Kagglers, and the Python community, Stackoverflow are there to help when you are stopped by errors. Before asking support, google your error and see if there is solution already and try it out. Yep, that is all you need to know..
Have a great journey.. see you the other side!!!!"

Easiest is to enrol in the courses offered by the many universities. Just take any masters degree on ML and AI to pursue. That in itself will not land you a job as is the case with any degree. You have to prove that you can use your knowledge in real world scenarios.
So as you are doing the course, start contributing to communities like Kaggle, Quora with your knowledge. There is so many real problems that can be solved, but the courses offered will not show every thing. So what to do?
Read a lot of machine learning books. It can be about the programming, the libraries, the cookbook usecases, visualisation ideas. Read atleast 250 Books. That is the important point in any career. The more you read, more your knowledge will grow. More you will contribute.

The below chart was created from the Kaggle Notebook. Yes, that makes me a Kaggler. When I entered the world of data, I knew only Jupyter notebook that is now bundled with Python portable distributions. The learning curve brought me to Colab and Kaggle.
There some thing intriguing in the above chart? Many of them don’t use any of the services shown above. What they use? Their own laptops, desktops or the internal service their company IT provides. Surprised!!
The AI or machine learning is a very old technology. The idea was used in Aerospace, Automotive and other high end design decision making. Even the laptop cooling is simulated using the equations.
The story is just starting. The data and its conclusions are unpalatable to many decision makers in this world. So after doing the grunt work with the above compute services, the decisions and supporting data needs to be again visualised. If just peek in the below chart one will be astonished at the choices for the business intelligence softwares.
Because it is finally businesses that use the results coming from the AI solutions. The data needs to be made pallatable to the decision makers. In this case the decision maker is you the reader and future top shot executive or engineer deciding the fate of your company and business.
It is not the next shiny compute processor, or the quantum chip that is going to change the world. It is how these compute resources are being used. We came this far, by using very simple micro processors. Like our brain, most of these processor powers are still under utilised all over the world. Even in your own laptops and desktops.
How to tap into that processing power? Learning to Program.
Yes, that is the only way to collectively grow. Learning to program will enable and empower everyone to decide based on the data available freely out there. The power will not reside in the companies like Meta, or Google (Kaggle is part of Alphabet, they are altruistic till now).

Think FB or Linkedin, when these products were marketed their USP was connecting supply and demand. After many ""pivots"" their USP is still ""Connecting Supply to the Demand"". The supplies and demands can be different. So...
What will be the Demand and Supply in Metaverse?
No it is not Attention. When the 8 billion or so enter the Metaverse there will be no issue of Attention. The issue of bringing money to the economy will be solved. Work and money will be un-tied as more machines take over. What will Metaverse supply. It will be supply and demand of #connection and #Work.
WORK
Yes, it will be work that needs conscious attention of an human being that needs to solved with intuition, creativity and skill. When your avatar gets into trouble with the world or other avatars, your work starts. There are myriad of process that will be run by your avatars that are constantly learning and doing. Your avatar plays, and you direct it.
CONNECTION
When your Alexa like avatar replaces you in the phone calls, and meetings the major issue will be getting real human connection. More people start moving away from the city, to their own land and population starts reducing with increasing life expectancy, the demand for real connection will sky rocket. Human connection at level of telepathy.
What if your avatar falls in love (gets in sync) with another avatar, and you can see how it unfolds, in metaverse? (Algorithms syncing? If they can learn, then syncing will be more easier) Algorithms have created telepathic connection between two people.
There will be always people not entering metaverse, and contended being in the reality. Today we have citizens and netizens. Tomorrow we will have humans and #metavatars(#metavs for short).
What will be the next driving force for human improvement? We have to wait and see, or decide it today.
Imagination is crucial for not only human survival but to be happy. The way tech can make this happen is in our hands. Imagine well…."

In Machine learning, then Reinforcement Learning comes close to mimicing the processes humans do in reality
Human brain categorises the various stimuli to our sense organs, and give back responses to the environment. Based on the responses we give, new stimuli comes back in a different way.
Take an example of the fruits below… that is a external stimuli. The response an human gives depends on his brain, and body make up at the moment he recieves the stimuli. Consider he is hungry, his brain propels him towards the fruit and he picks it up, and eats it(response). Body generates a stimuli to the brain
This time the stimuli is reduction of hunger and brain responds by secreting dopamine. The cycle continues in many types of stimuli, and the response changes. Every stimuli, and its response has been categorised. The categories are different for every human, acoss space and time. This process is simplified “Learning mechanism” humans.
This can be verified by the recent advances in the Reinforcement Algorithms that have taken up complex challenges. Alpha Go and its successor Alpha Star has been playing games against experience players of GO/ Starcraft and winning!!! That doesn’t make them Human, in any logical sense. They are still mimicing Humans, not humans.
We live only ones. Machine Learning Models die and instantiate a trillion times. The parallel of human life just being a program, has been discussed in depth in movies and comics. In real world(if you don’t consider the games as real world), there are certain issues the AI faces. Notable of them is Time and Opportunity to fail. Fail in ways Humans fail and learn from the failures.
Many of the activities we humans do are long term focused, and single time opportunities. You cannot grow up all over, by being born today.. (not likely, unless you can clone!!!) While this can be a huge issue to RL, since RL works by making many iterations, failing and then learning from them.
The RL also does a lot of simulation in order to learn. To simulate the reality takes lot of resources, and more complicated the simulation longer it takes to run. If the simulation is not complex enough, then RL will face unforeseen challenges when it is tested in the reality. (That is not a topic to discuss here)
We are forgeting one major point. We humans are CONSCIOUS. Brain is not the center of Consciousness, the MIND is. Mind is outside our Brain, the environment itself acts as part of the Mind. The sights, smells trigger hidden memories, don’t they. RLs cannot really absorb the details from the reality surrounding it in a way we are doing. They are not Conscious, the way we humans are."

An activity that is done repetively is a routine, and each routine will have multiple smaller routines. Lets take an example.
To make a cup of black tea is a routine. There are multiple steps to get black tea from water and tea bag. Dipping the tea bag in the hot water for either, 10 times, or until color sufficienty black or a fixed duration is a “Sub-Routine”
There are similar conditions in programming that processor executes. In computers, the sub-routines abstract the complexity of the routine and leave it to the experts. Even the sub-routines act as a security to avoid the sensitive data being leaked.
Most of the sub-routines will take care of low level heavy lifting work like writing numbers , objects to the memory and retriving it when required. The above picture shows the process of person searching a number with a lens, in the memory. This is laborious process, which is done by simple indexing, and sorting subroutines."

There is a very good introduction about the process mining in the below kaggle notebook, if you are interested in seeing the application in action.
Process Mining captures the digital footprints from any number of systems throughout an organization and organizes them in a way that shows each step of the journey to complete that process, along with any deviations from the expected path.(Paraphrased from the Kaggle Notebook)
Regular RPA involves using the UI to manually program the process automation. In process mining, the program tries to learn the steps necessary to complete a task, say to get shipping order, fill a billing Invoice, mail it to the customer. This is a business requirement, which is done by many people across multiple industry. When all the data is collected, the process can be “Mined” or learned by the Machine.

Reinforced learning Algorithms are promising to simulate the brain.

Blockchain gives a way to look at the world with distributed trust and get data that is very reliable and automated.
There are so many apps that collect your wants, needs and demands. These apps(read any app that is online) have some usefulness, so we use them and share our data. How about the activity that we do offline? This is done with sensors that are trustable by central body. Most cases it is humans collecting the data. Web3 enters this bottleneck area.
With help of distributed network, and IOT the real world physical data is collected. Then AI enters to leverage the power of algorithms to help those in need of taking decisions.
The above line looks so simple, and the moment you unpack the underlying technical complexity surfaces. Do a bit more research. The world with IOT and Blockchain can turn in to a videogame called watchdogs. In that the AI regenerates the crime scene. That, is the ultimate use case of Blockchain and Iot.
The concept of metaverse, real life simulation is also tied to the distributoed way of getting the data and showing it to the consumer. The reality that we live itself is possible because much of the sensor lies with ourself and our brain does the analysis. We react pretty quick. With the advent of Blockchain the entire cities, organisations can become like a huge organism. That can see, hear, learn and feel itself. (We are pretty long way from that though)

That is what creates the “Viral” effect. Secondly Memes themselves rides on the idea that is very familiar and memorable.
Algorithm is tasked with populating the things that your friends have watched, liked or commented. These are 3 simple activities. When 150 friends do any one of the action, your page updates.
Multiply that with other social media sites like twitter, linkedin joining with the algorithms running on your social media site. The speed with which the fake news propagates is very fast.
Humans are easily influenced by “Authority”. When the fake news is said in a authoritative tone, wording, with legitimate looking web url, we believe it to be true. Forward it to the social media pages, with just commenting or liking. The algorithm then spreads the news like a virus on your friends’ network. If one of your 150 friends sees it, and does like or comment the cycle begins.
Influencers who gather millions of followers or subscribers can create instant viral effect, by propagating the news to everyone in their followers’ list. Just a click.
This is all possible because of how the algorithms are written, and how they interact with each other. The fake news has been around for long time, only now the algorithms have made it so easy to move the news fast. This effect can be seen in how the world market reacts to any fearful or bad news.

Only the problem has to be looked from engineering and problem solving attitude. Any real world problem can be converted to algorithm or models now. That is very powerful.
Abstracting the working of ML, Cyber and SW Development is under rapid progress in AI field. Think about these professions, you can find frameworks, heuristics and certifications that one learns for years to master. All of these on top of undergraduate engineering course.
Really, is this necessary? Why to create such a burden on the children by making them study every subject under the universe and the make them feel bad when they arw unable to use it? Is the time spent is productive for our youth?
AI is making the career switching much easier, and frictionless in coming decade…. It doesn’t matter, whether you are developer or cyber hacker. You have to be conversant with how a computer thinks, a network moves data, AI learns from that data, and how marketing and product development fuels this entire cycles.
All this gives you a very different view of the world to thrive and have fun. Not just work and earn money."

If the data is labeled and your model learns from that data, then it is supervised. If data is not labeled then it becomes Unsupervised Learning.
The idea is unsupervised learning can provide patterns that humans or the systems did not think about. This kind of learning can be very useful when there are more dimensions (features), especially in Computer Vision, Time series analysis and NLP.
Supervised learning models have their benefits too. The benefit is, we get “Free Products”. Take quora, a free product where you get the answer for many different questions. The data is created by users and it is labeled by them and shared to quora engineers. Who can make models out of it.
One question that the quora data can answer,
Who is most likely to answer the next question you have?
Quora can look at all the questions that one person has answered, and classify whether that person can answer your question using Natural Language processing models.
Even a simple regression analysis on, how many question one person has answered till date, can be used to forecast the future.
These types of questions and their answers make the product managers at quora to make the product more efficient and interesting to play with.

Increased Efficiency is a good motivation but it is usually not sufficient.
I love to type. Yes, it is like how artist loves his brush. I love to type with only my right hand and use my left for doing some easy task like drinking tea while I type. It is possible with right hand Dvorak keyboard layout. There will be NO mouse near me. This is another way to force myself to learn shortcuts.
With this kind of setup, learning to use shortcuts on gmail is more than a necessity for me. I first learned the short cut keys by seeing the short cut help page for every action I need to do on gmail. The learning curve was pretty steep.
Once learned and my finger memorized the short cuts then it is breeze from that moment. Mostly I use mouse only when the gmail option doesn't have a shortcut for an action.
It is simple really if you have seen the hackers and uber programmers type. They use the key board like a pianist playing. The sound the keyboard makes will be mesmerising. This is possible with the inspiration and motivation.
Take it as a challenge to learn the shortcut and you will see opportunity every corner. Have a great day"

When I completed the Foundation series, I understood why Elon Musk is very bullish about humans going to MARS.
During a lunch at office, topic of what we really want to become or create came up. I instinctively told, to make “Robots that Think”. All I got was blank stares from my colleagues. In fact, I was clueless on where to even begin.
I started training for the machine learning and python programming. I explored the ROS system that is predominant in building robot simulation. The search further lead to computer vision and AI systems. Forecasting techniques using the RNN, LSTM and other algorithms. None of the AI sounding algorithms were really “Intelligence”
So did I find the answer?
The answer was already known to me. I am a trained public speaker and influencer. Speakers believe that words carry lot more power than the pictures. Words can be used to program the minds. Even our self-talk can alter our state of thinking. I had known this all along, and did not think about Natural Language programming.
When I was losing hope in finding the key to thoughts, and thinking I was searching for some books on Natural Language Programming. One of the books hit the cord and resonated.
NLPIA has the introduction to NLP like no other. The authors have extensive experience, and tied the lose ends to the “Thinking” problem of the robots. In fact, there are so many scientists working with the same passion and vision. “To Make the Robots (bots) think”. MS already released “Tay”, an AI Bot which became very anti-social, and was taken down.
So we already have thinking bots. The robots wiill be around sooner than we expected. Musk’s Mars mission wiill be more interesting and science fiction worthy, when the flights are controlled by the “Thinking Robots”. Stay tuned and passionate."

How can we exactly know, how AI works?
Answer is, By learning about how AI Learns. Get ready to enter the Rabbit Hole.
AI has been around for 50 years now. The back propagation idea along with the different type of activation functions that help the function to learn kick started the new era that we are in. (Which has lead to this question)
Idea is to create an algorithm that doesn't need the input to be a fixed type and output is usually numbers. How can different types of input types can be read by AI? Answer is, the physical world can be representend as matrix of numbers. The climate change, again shown as time series of numbers. How about voice and text, again can be represented in numbers.
The above matrix of numbers can be a picture, sound, temperature, sales or even quora upvotes. Data Scientists call them as “Representations”
What does the AI do with the Representations(Numbers)? Lets explain through some figures
The below figure is how Keras framework F Chollet visualises what the AI does. A cat picture is made by multiple parts, as shown below
The AI learns whether the given picture contains “parts of a cat”. If the picture has the parts then the picture contains the “cat”. If it contains something different, then it is “Not Cat”. The below picture is of the same cat, but in matrix form of cells and numbers.
The book, Deeplearning with Python explains the concept of AI, and how the internal parts work with figure above. Those with intent to understand, and curious to learn how the AI learns can read this book. The figure above doesn’t provide the mathematical intrecacies associated with the AI workings. That is already abstracted by the myriad of libraries that are written in C and Python languages.
The details shared above is to pique the curiosity of the readers to furter explore and learn more from the books, the online resource pages further.
These resources open up your imagination to higher level of where the world is going. Some of the abstract concepts can be difficult to understand the first time. Just persevere, and go through it again with more hands on approach. Slowly the details will seep through your mind. Very much like how AI learns…

F Chollet’s Deep learning with Python and
Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On Apply modern RL methods
These two books provide wealth of information about the state of art heuristics to create models from the data, and then use that model to predict things in the real world.
In AEI, the predictions are simply the human emotions. Consider the different emotions as different configuration of same face. This adds the complication that, billions of human faces can wear these configuration, without any warnings. Your work will be predict it.
The Kaggle competition platform, and the Google research group is doing so much research, and shared to the world. The data which is clean and labelled is also available. All you need is take these data, and start your research.

Math is beautiful. As the saying goes, beauty is in the “Eye of the Beholder”. I am good at solving mathematic puzzles, business challenges and calculate the returns on my investment. Basic tasks are helpful for daily lives. To have fun with mathematics is to begin abstracting the real life challenges into mathematical equations, and models. See how the models perform, and tweak it.
Take a look at the following course on computational thinking, which provides an intuitive way to think about AI, ML and other prediction softwares.
This course really answers your question with lots of hands on examples, and finally equips you to understand the most complex of the models, that predict the weather. So, to understand math behind these models, one has to be spend time and effort.
As already informed, being lazy and afraid spending time that might not give any output is the major challenge. So work on that, rest of the life will be fun."

Now the purpose is settled. Lets get thinking.
Lets get ourself a problem. We have to solve a complex multi-dimensional modeling, and find the force acting on the robot hand that we are designing. There are so many equations, and theory that goes into the robot designing. All these equations will involve calculations, and some of them are very repetitive. Now, we have a choice.
Either you write or go out and look if anyone else as written a program for it. You chose the later option and head to Github or Stackoverflow.
To your surprise, there is already a program with more options and help you to calculate not just the force, even it lets you make a animation of the hand moving. (ROS is excellent OS for developing robots, check it out) The problem you have is solved in most elegant manner possible.

To answer that, I need to tell you a lot about my life and stories it has, which can fill a 1000 page novel.

The output is a masive “model”. Model is a very long equation in algebraic terms. This is already covered.
How does this model know “my” face?
Someone has to still say to the convnet that, it is “your” face.
One of the ways this is done using numerous photos we upload on social sites and tag the photos to names.
Tagging is a way to help the neural network learn about the “features” of your face. It doesn't copy your face like how we humans see it. During learning the network converts your face as a “set of signals” that switches on/off the neurons in each layer and then assigns that pattern to your name “tag”.
When your face in reality is shown to the face recognition camera, it predicts with sufficient accuracy that it is your face.
Registering: When you enable face in your device, it asks you to show your face. It takes so many pictures of your face in multiple directions at high speed. Then sends it into the model and enables your model to “learn” your face. It doesn't copy your current face, it only model your face as mathematical equation.
Either way, the model will know the mathematics of your face and it will get stored in the server of the device. (Data of your ‘feature’, like face, finger print is always given away. We are not discussing what can be the data used for…)
This kind of recognition, is unlike how the humans recognize. The internal mechanism in our brain is very different. So neural nets are not like our brains neural network. The brain doesn't create equations.

How might this be possible?
RL is used for making programs that help to navigate problems by learning the constraints and possibilities. Brute force problem solving and learning is useful in games. The real world problems will become the games that RL will solve.

We will create the GAMES
Creating games today is called management. Whether entrepreneur or an employee, they are players in the game where the state, investors and customers are the game masters. Seeing this big picture creates a very unique experience.

This is apt for programming languages.
You need tbe skill to solve the problem. Some languages need more elaborate set up before you solve the problem. While others may need little or no setup. Python is later kind. Everything is abstracted away and you are given functions and objects to work.
Learning C and C++, even assembly language can make your life very easy. Easy because you will build your own stuff. That is like building your own house. It is done in places where there is no choice. Today there are so many people sharing their code and libraries. You have to just use them.
Having good grasp on algorithms, data structure can make a huge difference, but not really necessary. It does help you if you know an algorithm exist and it solves the problem you are having.
Start learning the easy part of the computer. The challenging part can be taken care by the scientist and engineers. Being the user of the code, you support those who write the algorithms for you. I always thank the open source community for bringing us most of the tech we use today. They are happy to be supported in return, by our data and usage information. It is a symbiotic ecosystem.
Its worth learning C or C++. There are better ways to solve the challenges you and the in society faces and contribute towards it. Think in this way, and if you learning C and contribute after 5 years, with language like Python or R, it will reduce to 1.5 years.

I want to argue against the premise that, “Programmers need smartness”
Ingredients: Dumb neural nets program themselves by playing the game a 100 thousand times. So to be a programmer you need that secret sauce called ability to break problems into simple steps, perseverance and relentlessness.
Reciepe: Smartness or any other esoteric skill help to speed up your work and submit for testing. That can be done by networks of artificial neurons. You as a human should be aware of which data to use for training the neural net and which way to get the output. These don't need smartness
Imagination: Seeing your work change the real world is very satisfying and empowering. When you build and others use and enjoy, the happiness is different. Money cannot buy that or even your incentives don't come near that. When you imagine that happiness and work, then all the world's smartness won't stand the chance.
Everyone has this three aspects so everyone can be a programmer. Now get breaking the problems and start typing code."

AI has given a tremendous boost in AD placement, connecting people, self driving cars, automatically detecting the image. These are trivial to us(except self driving cars), since daily activities are far from what AI can do till date.

Scientists contribute. Davinci, Enstien, Tesla, Neumann, Shanon, Rutherford were doing data science to test their theories. They contributed to the community, society and the world as a whole.
All these people were taken care by someone, while they were busy doing their scientific work. Yes, they did struggle. Tesla had to dig the ditch, when is A/C motor patent was to be recognised. Davinci constantly searched for patrons, who can sustain him. They did not seek out the work, the work sought them out.
Learn the skills of Data Science for that one purpose. To Contribute. To open your own eyes and that of others, who are “data blind”. It is fascinating to see the solutions that experience data scientists come up with, because they love to contribute. When their contribution is recognised by those who are looking for talent, then the interview is taken care by itself.
Benefit of Offline/ College course is the NETWORK. You meet people who know people in industry, looking for talent. Colleges provide this network for the fee they charge. The study is done by you, whther offline / online.
Today with online proliferation, there is so many avenues where the recruiters, companies and new startups are looking for talent. The NETWORK is now looking for talents. Online is mode is more challenging, and it is worth the effort. If you are a “GREAT DATASCIENTIST”, means you can find the opportunities in the online world, by analysing the data it provides. It will take time.
If you are having a family that can support you for another 2 years of self-study, participating in competition, writing code and training yourself in generating hypothesis and solutions, then pursue the online route.

It is an art, which requires creativity, concentration and patience. Mind maps can come in handy.
I learnt about mnemonics from Sherlock holmes novels. The alure to have palaces built with memories that are stored like computer chips fascinated me. It comes with a very big challenge, that is our capacity to concentrate and give attention.
Effective learning occurs when you practice something over and over, get positive feedback when you get it right. Mnemonics are not involved in the learning process. In the above picture, the kitten acts as a “mnemonic” to make you recollect that I spoke to you about “learning” & “feedback” in this answer. In order to learn from this answer, you have first recollect and then use the answer. Then you will learn.
Mnemonics are involved only in remembering the concepts, facts and theory. You create a database of things you have read in your brain. This can be useful for remembering numbers, long numbers. Lists of things, and associated calculations. The skill is extremely useful in business settings, where you have to bring the up the numbers very fast. Take decisions at lightning speeds.
To use it in learning at school, you can train yourself to remember the formulae, the list of symbols and process you need to follow to achieve a particular output or solve a problem. <Note this point> You have to recollect the formulae, lists or process and try them in real problems, and learn how well you can solve them.
Mnemonics are similar to small application that you have on your smartphones. When you touch the app, it calls a window pop open and populates the data you need. Your brain will become the smart phone with many mnemonics on top of it.
Learning can be augumented by mnemonics, if you are aiming to pass school, college, law exams. Then in real life the drive to remember what you learnt is purely dependent on how passionate you are about the subject. Sherlock holmes is famous for saying, that he doesn’t remember whether the earth revolves around the Sun or something else, if it doesn’t help to solve his case.
Just be strategic where you spend your time and concentration. That will determine your future. Have a great time learning new things."

Findings_2:Getting scores in School exam don’t translate in to Money. Putting your skill to good use to others coverts it to money.
Findings_3:Money is attracted when you creatively apply your learning in your young age, and seeking out opportunities. (This is the toughest part for many kids who have completed school, and got good scores in exams).

Age 28: He did his doctorate in Chemistry and wrote excellent research papers. His passion for chemistry, the reactions and the catalysts could be felt when you enter his room. He has room full of chemistry books, stacked 6ft from the floor.
He is a very personable guy, and easy going too. He has loving girlfriend. After doctorate, he started online coaching for kids in Australia, sitting in India. This is where he found the market for his skills.
Age 29: Initially his expense was much less, as he was young. His girlfriend was understanding. He steadily started gaining reputation all the while sustaining himself with meagre returns that he was getting from the online classes. He was finding how much the market will pay for his skills.
Age 31: After 3 years he had substantial online channel on Chemistry, and a solid reputation built around his coaching. He also learnt about the online education mode and hired 3 tutors to teach for his students. << This is where he got his break. He started exploring creative ways to market, not only his skills, but that of others too.
Age 34: He is having excellent profession that is done from anywhere, anytime that he preferred. People are working for him under his terms. He is doing, what he likes and leaves the difficult/ boring activities to those who find it interesting, and pays to them.
Age 35: He is married to his girlfriend, and roaming around India staying in tourist places like Goa, Rishikesh and Manali for months and moving to a new location if the place bores them.
The friend here, did invest on his studies, which is a “Business Investment” and then invested another 3 years with meagre salary. This he did when he did not need money, at age 28 to 31years.
My Mentors:
I have seen the same storyline in the life of Warren Buffett, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, N.Tesla, Andrew Carnegie and many more successful people. All these people started out like my friend, at very young age to do one thing, and stuck to it for their entire lives.
What Next?
Now you understand why I say, starting the business at 25 is the best thing to do.
What are your skills that you can Market?
Does your skill have any Market? If yes, then where it is?
What is the Market ready to pay for your skill?
How much revenue / sales can your skill get you in a day, week, month, year?
All the above questions can be answered by deligent search and relentless hustling. Remember the money you are earning is to keep you afloat and liquid (means you can spend the money to eat, live and cloth yourself, and have a good time with family & friends). The decisions you take at 25 years has to be aligned with philosophy of being liquid and afloat.
Everything else is eyewash…. It is your life, and trust only your guts and logic. Worship in the altar of Concentration and Logic. It is a brilliant feeling to be young, with stars in the eyes & dreams in the mind. Pursue them, with logic and relentless hustle. World is made better by such strivers."

If you are going to do something 50% of time, How about learning to do that effectively. Learn to REST and SLEEP Effectively, RELAX Effectively.
Relaxing is something many don’t learn for their whole life, and they prematurely go to “permanent sleep” .
Why Relaxation?
Salvador Dali and Leonardo Da Vinci, the two most creative and influential artists known to us, have always given highest value to “Relaxation”. They used skillful relaxation to
Idea that one has to learn something when sleeping arose, as I relaxed completely searched for an Idea for this question. Once you relax you see images in your minds eyes, that provide you the answer/ solution you are seeking for the challenge at hand.
How to Relax?
It is all in the “Muscles”. Out of 1000 muscles in your body, your brain can consciously control 639 skeletal muscles. These muscles are constantly talking to your brain, and asking nutrition, transferring stimuli and chatter. Your brain has to work for these muscles. The moment you relax the muscles, their communication to your brain halts. The load on your brain reduces. Brain can provide energy to concentrate, create and communicate with Ideas.
When to Relax?
This is best done, when you start sleeping, or when you want to rest, while your are learning. Any comfortable posture is fine. Either close your eyes, or concentrate your sight on a blank wall/ table. The quick way, is to selectively relax your muscles by giving attention to each muscle. Slowly move your attention from your bottom of your feet and move steadily upwards relaxing all the muscles along the way until your head.
Release the tension around the groin, abdomen, and solar plexus. You can visualise that your muscles are becoming heavy and you are sinking or melting slowly into the chair, or into the bed. Be in that condition for atleast 20 minutes.
Why Learn Relaxation?
_ Champions of this world, are masters in Relaxation
_ It is fairly simple to do.
_ You can practice it perfectly i.e. you will get feedback if you have done it right. Feedback is the Freshness you feel once you Relaxed.
_ Effectiveness of relaxation can be measured in your daily outcomes.
_ Relaxation is the start for many visualisation techniques that are used in sports like Martial arts, Golf, Football and Basket ball.
_ Relaxation acts as a “clear”/ “Reset” button for your emotional situation
_ Relaxation help you to “delay” the negative response that you might give in your daily life, like anger, frustration, anxiety
_ Relaxation helps you to free yourself from your inner demons, and be in the present moment.
_ Finally it helps you to decide better by seeing all the data available at hand.
Get ready to live life like a champion. Have a great time ahead.

The products in this world follow the famous product life cycle. Based on that, NFTs are currently in the “innovators” stage. It has to reach the “early adopters” and then “jump the chasm” to mass adaptation.
Will NFTs jump the chasm? Yep, it sure will
When NFTs will jump the chasm? There are more than 50 factors that are required for the NFTs to Jump. All the factors require many people to use it, and explore. Basically, spend time and money.

Why stick with one tech when you can learn both and that too in a very short time. To do that one needs a overwhelming reason. Last 24 months has shown how far the world has progressed as started learning about these two technology.
Super Intelligence == Superminds
Think about these two tech as the “brain” and “mind”. Brain is Blockchain, with its interconnected network of people deciding and trusting decentrally. While the Mind is Artificial intelligence. Lot of interaction means truck load of data. Where there is data, there is Mind(intelligence). The Blockchain and AI are technology that can create super-intellgence soon.

Blockchain ==
Berkley university has an awesome course on Blockchain, which you can access through edx.com.
There is a phenomenal course by AtoZ channel in Youtube.
The main blockchain concepts are Algorithmic Game Theory and Token engineering , again in youtube has the courses.
Take a deep breath and dive into them and binge wartch them… Then read the book on Meme engineering. The Blockchain world is a new meme or idea that has taken hold. (It is a fascinating concept)
AI ==
There are countless courses to learn artificial intelligence, just don't take them!! Yes don't go near them….
Instead start with data visualization courses. Train yourself to visualise like a pro. Why?
Artificial intelligence works on three paradigms. Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced learning. All these three have one thing in common, that is they generate data as output and you must know how to understand the data. There are statistics and tests involved which again needs visualization, and imagining too.
This takes practice, feed back and perseverance. Good news. You can get the first two very easily. There is so many places like Kaggle website where you can practice and get feedback. 3rd, perseverance has to be fueled with your mindset aimed towards creating massive impact or contribution to the community. You will be valued for the insights you bring to table or in this case the models.
When you are through you will be energized and wiser. Will be able to guide and contribute. Even get a new career started or might startup on your own. Possibilities are endless. Take the plunge…. See you on the other side. Have a great learning experience."

Managing a team inside a company needs understanding about the company and the the market that it is serving. Understanding comes slowly over time, as more exposure and projects are undertaken. Mid level executives are faced with two major actions in their daily lives
Which of the above activity suits you the most? Managing the target, or the Budget? Depending on that, you can move either horizontally or vertically in an organisation.
Higher you go, the more stringent the targets would be. It is obvious that, mission critical sales,and deliveries have to be completed.
Horizontal movement to a different but related department can give you an overview of the organisation, and provide you with fresh view towards your career.
There is always the best option, that is to not to change anything. This has the benefits too. Instead of career, you can think about other dimension of life that needs to be improved. Or it could be a project that you wanted to do.
The idea of specialisation by taking an executive course is still a viable option. The investment into that course, and subsequent returns as salary might lead to opportunities as well. The specialisation has to be done once you decide which you want to manage.
Decide like a top executive. Table the above 3 choices (stay, move vertical, move horizontal) that you have, and list the dimensions you want to rank them, like
These are just some examples. You can add some that you find important, and give them marks. The marks for each can range from 0 to any number. Lower the number means lower the priority, higher means more priority. This exercise will help you decide by showing what you really value.

Important point is they are experts, and don't need your support or guidance in their areas. So safely delegate decisions to them, but give them the range upto which they can decide.
Remember that the more decisions they make, more learning they will get. Also you will be able to lead them better.
Instill a mindset that that decision at their level has to be taken by that level only. Shouldn't be escalated.
Hope these pointers give you some place to start and lead the team better. Have a great time."

Mind happens when there is consciousness which in turn happens by emergent behavior. When a thing that is connected in a network can do some basic computation, like some decision or action then this thing becomes part of the emergent behavior.
The action taken by each node will be simple while the entire network can do lot more than simple action. Swarm Robotics, iot tech, Blockchain tech all are steadily marching towards such a connected network. Ability to communicate fast adds to the speed of the network.
Development of mind and consciousness is an ongoing struggle between computer and bio sciences. We are going towards creating the ultimate mind, the Super General Intelligence. That's when the singularity is expected. The world is going to be better with such advances."

The pain you are facing is currently faced by atleast dozen other guys around this world. Just pray for their well being and peace of mind. You will momentarily feel the pain reduce.
I had faced similar situation and its life transforming. Be glad that you have faced such a situation and still being alive (mentally) and asking for help. You are trying to be happy again. Give yourself a pat on your back.
Keep reminding yourself that, the past cannot be changed. What is on the picture is not the girl who is your girlfriend now. That picture is someone in the past. This way of detachment with time and space will alleviate your pain further.
Finally, push yourself towards the Future. It is like climbing the mountain after your legs have given up. Your body is working on autopilot. Slowly start visualisation of your future goals, how you want your lives to be? After all, your girlfriend expects you to forgive and love her irrespective of what mistakes she does or had done.
Confront her if you feel it is required. And talk your heart out.(That will be your mistake). Ensure she forgives you. Then both will be even and can live happily ever after… Just try to stay together. Its troublesome, downright irritating sometimes, but it is all worth it.

This takes effort, and imagination. Why Imagination? When you are solving a analysis problem, the solution needs to be imagined and then the concepts, tools and programs are to be used.
Kaggle would be a great place to come up to speed on the python programming. There is dedicated courses that can introduce you to the application of the various machine leaning models. If you learn the underlying concepts, the programming language themselves are interchangeable.
Python or R can be as complicated as piloting an aircraft or can be as simple as driving auto gear car. It depends how deep you want to progress. How many application area you want to excel at. Which modeling and type of problem you want to study more.
Starting with simple data visualisation to complex computer vision artificial neural networks can be Programmed. Even automated modeling called Auto ML has been developed to completely automate much of the analysis process.

Programming your mind to think in the positive terms is a skill that your mind has to learn. It is kind of a “Looping” situation. How to start the “Positive Loop”? TL:DR (Jump to Summary at bottom)
I am a avid reader of many leaders, inventors, philosophers and Fiction. We see a particular dimension of their lives in these books. Then it struck me. All these people must have had same foibles that I have, since they are humans. Yet, they made their life so memorable, that we are reading about them today.
They made their life memorable not for their achievements, but for their failures. Take late Steve Jobs. If you look at his life from multiple perspectives, by reading his biography, seeing him work, hear him talk, read about the contemporaries who worked with him, you will see a pattern emerging. Pattern that is similar to your life or those around you.
He was a brilliant man, who lead a life simply and dedicated to make the world a better place. He had immense energy, and phenomenal perseverance,. If he has immense energy, and you have little energy, then use that to make an impact on this world. The impact is what matters. Impact could be anywhere in your life..
When you realize that your entire life can be dedicated to create impact, then you see a Bigger Picture. Life is Not just about you. Your mindset expands to include everyone around you first, and giving priority to their well being. You will realized that others being well, will make you lead a fulfilling life. The act of embracing the humanity is a common thread in many of the leaders, inventors and notable scientists.
I have tried personally and it works. The moment I face an Hardship, I pray for those “Unknown Others” who might be facing same Hardship or pain. Especially, when I was down with “Fever” for 10 days and having severe pains and hullcinations, only this strategy worked. I “Prayed” that those others suffering by fever to become well and healthy. In that process, my mind gave my body the energy and rest. Mind is the starting point of this reality.
Yes, we humans are together in this “Tiny Rock”. The surge of positivity, and affection that arises from the “Prayer” removes traces of negativity and fills you with positivity. Even when you are sufferring.
To summarize
Life is fun and long, keep it going on. Have a great future."

Understanding the basic of the technology comes first. Current changes in business models have moved the risk of data breaches to the highest levels. The insights one gains from the data is more than the data itself. Any internet facing server can be compromised if it becomes a target.
With the risk explained, the security now is about providing privacy in such ways to make the user feel safe. Learning the exploits of the software and hardware is only go sofar. After that it is about the human usage of the technology which becomes the bottleneck.
Start with technology, and get hands on experience with production environment. Then setup a experiment platform on your own and try learning the ways to break the technology. Then use the online platform to further your knowledge by seeing others providing the solution.
This way of book, hands on, self experimenting and seeking expert solution is the norm. Stackexchange, Kaggle, Quora, Reddit are platforms that provide rich introduction and support network for you to learn.

Why this happened?
What we do with the money is mostly guided by the marketing and the influence the surrounding has on us. Also how effectively you have fixed your vision and imagine about learning what you want to learn.

Startups are being touted as good way to make a living. In reality, the startup entrepreneur have necessary training in their young age. Elon musk was a trained physicist. Larry and Sergey of Google had Montessori schooling. Warren buffett did nothing apart from reading financial reports and thinking about businesses.
Being creative and generating ideas need lot of reading too. In order to get a patent there is lot of research to be done. Many inventors in the past were inventing same devices and later fought for priority in the courts. Read The Wizard, book about Nikola Tesla. Similarly to be original is just a concept, to put it into action needs tremendous discipline, which again is a skill you learn today.
Going in depth into any subject by understanding is very time consuming. Every question you rise will have an answer. It takes effort to find out. Sometimes the answer is in plain sight and we miss it. During the teen age, there is already pressure from various direction and creative energy is the highest. Temper it with discipline, moderate it with artistic hobbies and exploit it to improve your memory and retention.

Behind all this the idea of delayed gratification and prolonged meditation. When you have to do a project of a life time there too you have to stand in line for many things. As I was typing this, one of my own family challenge dawned on me, and thought how would I stand as a leader and patiently solve it.

That is the speed with which the smartphone processor works today. All we do is, get frustrated if the app doesn't load, and change the phone. In the past, there was no such option. One had to improve the way they work with the phone and continue using it.

To begin with entrepreneur has training in engineering, management and sometime in related Science. So unless you want the minds to be like Leonardo da vinci who learnt everything from inquiry and curiousity, the minds are better trained with education.
Later, the choice needs to be available in front of the youngsters. This is possible by educating them for self-realization rather than fodder for organisation. Question could be
How might we train the young minds for self-realization rather than running behind foolish near term goals… have a great day.."

Ask questions like,

How might you liberate yourself?
What if you can fly or swim?
Where will you go for vacation?

Mind works with creativity, alpha waves and your body. Go silent and listen what your body and mind says. Just listen. One need not act on everything that our brain decides to act, after all it is a machine that runs on Harmones and Protiens. Change your food habits. Work out regularly, even a simple 10 min jog will do. Meditate for 10 mins and share love to the universe. Connect your heart with your mind, and spread your vibration around. Show your brain alternatives for the cravings you have.
Mind runs on ideas, thoughts and vibration that is around you. Keep the vibrations and attract the thoughts that calms down your cravings, anxiety. Even then if you need a release, go ahead pleasure yourself. In Moderation… it is the harmones that is acting up.
Having a healthy mind is more important to have a healthy brain and body. Every challenge has multiple solutions. Seek out the solution that is more suitable to you. Ask the right questions, the answer is out there… Answer will seek you out..
Some other tactics for your perusal…
I believe that the ideas that we attract and the life that we visualise is what materialises. The craving and lonely feel is very natural, and currently the world is seeing tremendous change, which in itself is alienating human emotions. In such a world, it is always the most basic of your visions that saves you…
Decide what you want and envision for your future self. Forget about the goals that you set. There is lot of peer pressure, and influence involved. The goal/ vision I talk about is the basis for your living. What is that?
Why you wake up in the morning? What might be a day that is filled with vision look like?
Ask these questions and wait for your mind to answer.

In addition, the webpages just automate the routine prescription the doctor gives to patients.
Most of the patients have (for example) flu, stomach pain, eye irritation, allergies. These are the problems that create pain. Since patients want remove pain, they search for the doctor and medicine. So pains as listed in above example can be treated routinely. So the webpages, no need for doctor. Assuming, the patient know his body very well. (which is not the case)
There are side effects whether you do Googling or visit Doctor. Even after 7 years of study and years of experience, medicines and doctors are not the solution to many of the human suffering.
The student learns the medical science out of his passion to acquire knowledge, invest in his future and stimulate his brain. When he becomes a doctor he serves the public with his insights, and provides treatment and cure which is beneficial to patients. Doctor can do it in many ways, including the webpages route.
This far, it is philosophy… now the answer
Becoming a doctor, is a intellectual pursuit of the individual along with passion to serve the human kind. “Why I should spend years studying?” has to be answered by the individual, and not by me, the public, the society or the demand market.
Webpages are not going to be conscious, passionate or intellectual. Here the public can talk and debate."

One has to know the difference between Visualisation and Fantasy. Visualisation involves only you. Fantasy involves another person or organisation.
It works because when your Visualisation is strong, you imagine the ways to make the visualisation real. You ask, how might you make use of the current resources and achieve what you are visualising.
Some call this vision, others visualisation. Some others goals. All points to the same thing. That you wish to become something else, from what you currently are. The vividly you can visualise, and include details in it. More the chance for getting the visualisation work.
Also, there are sub forces like laws of attraction, belief of confidence, self-worth and self-esteem boosting. Psycho-Cybernetics the book explains everything in detail. The author was a renowned plastic surgeon, and his insights are ground breaking. Take a look at that book.

I recently heard a quote credited to Buddha. If you like a flower, you will pluck it and if you love a flower you will water and make it become better.
How simple to differentiate between loving and (infatuating) liking.
Another simple way to differentiate is your mom. You love your mom don’t you? Does your heart beat rise when you are around your mom? Not really, correct.
If you love her then you must see something that you cherish in her, apart from her pheromones that are triggering your body to react. In that way the relationship with her can be much deeper, and more engaging than just another short romance.
Also, start practicing self-love. If you love yourself more when you are around someone, then also it means you love the person. If you simply feel attracted to the person, then you will want to consume them.
You see the pattern right. Try to be a good friend to her, and be open minded and flirt. Even make out with her if you guys become close. If it all works out, and still you guys want to stay together, then it means you guys want to grow with each other.
But if things don’t work out, and she or you move on then try to work out the situation amicably, without hurting or getting hurt. Remember, there is always your soulmate for you. She may not be the one. Culture calls this breakup, nature calls this trial and error.
This will be bit tough without external guidance, and good advisor. So talk with your best friend or cousins about your feelings always. Try not to overwhelm her with all your insecurities. Most of the current relationship ends especially due to overwhelming pressure on each individual in relationship.
Love, Self-love, having open conversation with your close friends about your feeling apart from her. All the very best for your future."

I have been researching the RPA or Robotic Process Automation softwares, and using them for quiet sometime. The robots, even the kind with AI and ML can work on activities that are structured or atleast semi-structured. I have shown examples of such activities in industries and their departments.
There are not many processes that the robots can do, effectively take away the job of one person. Below are some of the important factors that impact how challenging it would be to build robotic processes.
Even if the robotic processes take over the impact is not more than 30% to 40%, that means remaining 60% to 70%, humans have to support the robots.
Above is the example of the impact on Insurance processes, and the outcome is max of 28%. All these data is for the Robotic processes, that are done with the computer with help of us humans. I have not even started discussing about the real world. (Research can be found here,
)
My argument is, if the automation of the processes that we do on a computer is reaching only 40%, then how challenging will be the automation of process that needs interaction with real world? Much difficult, since our universe in continuous in nature. While even the best AI / ML can work on discontinous or Digital data only.
When the AI and ML can really become powerful to human level?
When there is so many AI machines that are learning countless processes and sharing their learning with each other at rapid rate, and start creating patterns out of it and change the world. That is when AI can be really powerful. IOT and Industry 4.0 is trying to achieve that. Albiet at a very slow pace.
So when such a emergent AI system can arrive, may be in next 10 years or may be longer. That is not a guess. There are so many research that points towards this 10 years horizon.
Then why am I claiming Robots will not take all our Jobs? Because our Jobs will become different. In next ten years time, lot will change for the good. There are alternates being researched for Work. Instead of doing dreadful and boring work, we all will be handling the challenging and creative work. Where you will know your worth.
What about those who don’t want to be creative or take up challenges? They too will be engaged by the society and the government. Like how the childrens are engaged in schools and colleges, the citizens will all be part of the economy in some way. You and I have to think, how to make that happen. Questions must be about how to use Robots and increase engagement of people in a society? Try answering that question.

No wonder you are bored. Not with your career really, but with your life.
Ask yourself, Do You really need a career change? Or is it something else that you are missing in life that is making you think that career change is an answer.
I have had this feeling that the “Other” career path will be “Oh so Interesting”. In fact, that is really not the case. What ever career has chosen you, just do it and try to excel at it. After 10 years of working in a career, your creativity starts blossoming, at that time switching career will give unwanted side effects.
With all that warning, now I come to the answer.
There are so many ways you can switch your career paths. Start by deciding which career you want to take. Say, if you want to enter into purchasing, then do research on the purchasing department, talk with purchasing people in your friend circle and gather the skills you need for the job.
Then see what skills you have developed over your experience. Once you have done that, then you can match your current skills with the skills that are needed for the new job and start applying. You will start getting calls.
There, it is the proven method used by many to switch careers. Again, think about what exactly your vision in life is and then take this step. Have a great future."

The shop can accomodate 4 customers and 2 barbers at a time. On top of the shop was a monitor, that showed the entire space. Puzzled by the monitor in the barber shop, asked the guys working there, Why the camera & Monitor?
1) Camera shows whether the barbers are working
2) It shows how many customers are there at any moment
3) What raw materials are being used.
4) how much inventory is available
5) What is the expected wait time for the customers
6) How efficient the barbers are.
Connected camera is stationed in 4 shops all around the city, and the owner of these shops fields the customer calls, and diverts them to shop where they can be serviced.
Connected Camera multiplied the productivity of the owner, brought him more returns for the fixed cost of the investments, helped him expand. Important point is, owner was able to provide jobs and help those young barbers to have a good life and develop their skills.

Females can spread their love to everyone in their life. From their parents, friends, siblings and their crushes or boy friends. To boys this concept is alien, as it is mentioned in Men are from Mars book. Due to this way of thinking, guys feel ashamed of loving two girls at the same time. While girls have no such issue.
This has to be understood by the boys and they have to speak up with their girl friends. Because the girl friends are not going to chit chat with their boys all day. They have social life.
All the movies, serials and various media don’t show this reality. Owing to this, all boys further get into the trap, and feel either troubled or ashamed.
Also, if you say to your girl friend that you love another like a very best friend, like you care for your childhood male friend, then she would understand. She might get jealous and angry, that is all. If she knows you well enough, then she wont stop you. She will face lot of inner turmoil, and insecurity. So ensure, you show extra care for her and be there when she needs you the most. (The other girl really is not worth all the trouble you have to endure, so use your time wisely. After all, Time is Wealth, you have better dreams, and life to pursue)
Actions speak more than words. Listening is more important than talking. Being happy is more important than being right. Complaining, Criticising and Condemning are best kept at distance.
Have a wonderful life ahead.
PS : BTW, if you love the other girl same as your girlfriend, then also discuss with your girlfriend. It is for her own benefit and well being. Be patient when you discuss it with her. She wont be patient though, if you are very important to her.
Remember you are lucky to be loved by two girls. So love yourself more, and be happy."

The significance is to the Ears, and the body language. 99% of the communication happens through listening and expressing. This is the major challenge that we all are facing in this online meeting era.
Since we are unable to rely on the body language over the online meetings, we have to maintain hierarchies, have power distances and strict process flows. These all have nothing to do with communication.
Future holds more challenges in this communication area.Because the online mode, the emotion can be hidden. The facial expression can be modified. The face you show can be made attention grabbing. Which in reality may not be the case.
Listening has to be given more emphasis, like how we say to kids writing exams. We ask them to read the question twice. Like that, listen twice and speak once. One will be more wiser and saner.

As human species leaving out the personal touch might make us a different levels of being.
The Solarians in the Issac Asimov Robot series novel have such a technology. They call it viewing (asimov predicted this tech before 60 years). The change that occurs in the humans living with such technology changes them at visceral level. It is a must read for anyone who thinks that personal meeting shall be replaced by digital “on the glass” meetings.
We as humans live to love and love to live. It is a paradox that society is creating so much tech so humans can flourish, and undermine some of the basic necessities inadvertently. But I digress.
No, in person meetings won't be replaced by technology. Not in next generation or next to that. Tech has the capability to replace it. I predict that after 3 generation, that is after the current youth become great grand fathers, their great children might use such meetings easily. Till then, there are other more interesting ways to get connected.
PS: Even though it will happen at the near end of my life, I am imagining how will romance and courtship happens in such scenario? What will conflict look like over the internet?

If it depicts accepting one’s fate -such as a prisoner and death. An expression of resignation and inevitable fate, with the head looking downward, or stoically upraised with a glare of defiance? The nature of both the donor or executioner has to be taken into consideration,.an expression of benevolent satisfaction, or a cold, heartless face of stone or vengeful pleasure for the executioner.

In our society, there is lot of activity when it comes to finding something. Whether it is lost key or lost love or in our case a Goal that is not found. Goal is simply to live isn't it. Really, what difference does it make whether you achieve or not.
We came into this world from our mother's womb crying like crazy, wiggling the heck out of the doctor. For what? To search ? To wait?
To LIVE. To live a full life is not a goal or an objective. It is a journey. The day one realises that, then age, gender, social rules everything goes for the toss. Only the journey stays.
Have a wonderful journey is what I wish to all."

This has been proven as a fact by a very strange kind of exercise performed. I would suggest you to read the Book Force Vs Power to understand more about this concept.
Not all books will increase your consciousness. Only a selection of books that come into your life can increase it. The higher the consciousness more will be your power, and less will be your use of force. I am still fascinated with the Force Vs Power book even today.
The good or bad books, they are creation of consciousness. The more books that expands your consciousness, more free your mind becomes to hold different ideas. The higher your consciousness, the higher your self-awareness. The way surrounding impact your mind radically changes as your consciousness raises. So if the 1st ten pages of the book doesn’t raise your feeling in someways, then stop reading the book.
Books are like my best friends who only give and expect nothing in return. Such friends are themselves high in consciousness. However some books asks something in return, like the author tries to influence us to share the content, or the characters are extolling virtues or vices, the underlying moral is against the human nature, and books try to change your beliefs. These books might be felt at your gut level. Stay away from these books.
The world is filled with vibrations of various frequencies. The books that come in your life depends on the frequency you are vibrating in. You vibrate based on the thoughts you hold in your mind. Realign them towards higher consciousness, and the way will open up.
There you have the answer. I hope you get wonderful books in your life and they stay as your friend for ever. Have a great life."

That is how people who get what they want with out much effort. I mean they put effort, which to us might seem less and still they get their target.
The mindset can be achieved by 1st setting yourself a strong vision. Since our mind loves to center on one thing, this vision has to be something that you can improve to achieve and it must depend on you and only you. That means the vision is about how would like to feel, love and live irrespective of what the situation might be.
In order to achieve this vision you can have many goals and do necessary exercise to keep yourself on track. However your vision still has to subjective. It might make sense only for you. (Vision of a company is different, so don't confuse that with personal vision)
This is the starting point for homing your thoughts to your vision when you feel anxious. Your mind will home to your vision and center itself. Then start feeding positive thought and ideas. Read good books, articles, biography, anthologies for getting ideas. The point is to keep your mind fully concentrated on positivity, and can do attitude."

So how many books you read is immaterial. What matters is coming back to book and practicing the ideas that author has shared with you.
The books lets you create connection with the author and use him as a distant mentor. In 5 hours, even though one can complete the book, the points in the paragraph can be missed.
Most books are not like reciepe books, where if you miss one instruction the rest of the actions will not work. The books we read can have instructions skipped and still it will work for us. Only the outcome will be lesser than expected.

The comes asking the correct questions. When you believe that you have the idea, and then ask question accordingly, the results are amazing. How to ask such questions? Here is a hint for the same.
Being creative at home is the starting point of being creative in life and at work. I was blessed to read Leonardo Da Vinci’s biography. A fabulous account of what one can do sitting at home.
Keeping your brain calm, and having the attitude to find ideas and discuss creative solution can lead to much better life. It also moves you to a different level of consicousness. You are more generous, greatful, smile more and bring smile on others face. Humour occurs naturally. Health increases dramatically. Your purse becomes heavier and bank account swells. Lot of benefits for just being creative…
Have a wonderful life and all the best for achieving your creative ambitions."

With a team of 100 people who are dedicatedly working towards making the world IOT ready, and bring more algorithms to the forefront is phenomenal. EnVis has a turnover of 200 Cr INR, and profit of 60Cr INR.
I had begun EnVis 2 years ago, after the prominent need for established IOT professionals were becoming a norm. Everywhere from home to factory, the IOTs were proliferating. The governments were providing the impetus to implement the frameworks, owing to the better manageability, predictability and conformity that could be achieved.

Major electrical charging network line the countries through the cities. The infra has become ubiquitous.

2030 : Life Automated and Spending time on the passions
I look at the world in the month of Mar 2030. Tesla had sucessfully launched many of its Starlink rockets successfully. The world around has started an industry supporting the space colonies. The research that needs vacuum to be conducted starts moving out to space. Many devices that needs precision during assembly are done so in space and brought back.
Homes 100% autonomous, Transport has become 90% autonomous, factories 85% autonomous, colleges, schools and hospitals 75% autonomous, Countries and cities 60% autonomous. When I say autonomous, the administrative activities are automated, the system creation and overall control lies with those passionate in spending time with the machines, algorithems and challenges. Quantum computers are housed at every smart city to manage the challenges. Quantum programmers and algorithm enter the curriculum of the schools in USA, Europe, China and India.
Human are seeing unprecedented free time for following their passion.
Marriages are becoming more soul oriented than contract oriented. With humans becoming self-aware at younger age, calm brain leads them towards better connections and more intimate relationships. Relationships turn toward nourishing and enriching than just surviving the chores of the day.

Brand new decade begins. Singularity is just around the corner, the emergent network of conscious machines will become a reality before 2045. The strange acceleration begins…."

Then take something mundane… how about toothbrush. How might you use it differently? These are tools and use for all your life. If you can come with different ideas with these simple things, you will become confident with more challenging work related creativity.

Because you love yourself more when you are around your wife, for what she has done for you.
Because love is coming from the heart attached to your animal brain, while cheating happens from genitals connected to the animal brain. I am sure you have a very strong heart for still loving someone close to you even though they cheated on you.
Instead of asking “Why I still love, ask Why I must love?”. Answer is, to have a heart and body that is as strong and kind as that of a mother. Take a long term view and these small incidences vanish. Make her realise what she is doing and try bringing her up in life. After all she might be missing something in you, so ask her to find a different apart from sleeping with other guys. Also tell her about her body, that is like a personal space. Not everyone can enter.
Above all if she continues this and you find that you are not loving yourself when you are with her then leave. You May not ask for divorce. Just separate and give her the freedom she is craving. Believe in your love, and she will come for you.
If not, you have your sanity and good health. Use it for better things in life. You have only to gain. See the positive perspective of life. Have a great day.
Oh by the way, forgive her from your heart. This is important to make yourself love her more and lead a life free from suffering. Attract happiness and thoughts that cherish and nourish you. Forgive her and forgive yourself too. After all you could have loved her more,😀😀
Again have a great day. There is so much to life than just family or relationship. I am practicing the above, with my own family member who cheated financially. With friends who is unable to let go of animal nature and climb up. I can say it is a challenge."

What they and you have in common?? A very common job. It is how they do the very common job in uncommon ways. They were creative, so are you. Takes a bit of priming to bring creativity out. Creativity is a day to day activity, for a better life, and happier soul.
I too was determined to change my job, and try a new profession. I was detered by the reduced salary and high risk that new profession creates. Then I did the following small exercise.
I analysed the purpose of switching my profession
Why I want to find a different profession?
Why I want to make my life Interesting?
Why I want to feel exhilerated in the morning?
Why I want to lead to better life?… Ah haa
…. That is how I realized the question is different. Instead of searching for a different profession, I asked,
“In what ways might I make my job interesting and lead a better life?”
After a creative brain writing activity on a sheet of paper, I came up with a quirky idea. I had seen many characters in movies, who can do stuff with single hand. So I wanted to type with only right hand, while I use my left hand to sip coffee, or drink water… This is just one of many many ideas.
I did the Why, where, who, what, when and How question on “Typing with one hand” Idea. Then found that, there is a existing keyboard template in windows itself to type using single hand.
I have stayed with the current organisation for more than 7 years, and still counting… Not long enough!!! I wanted to quit the 2nd year…
Here is how it works:
Always, Start with the Question!!! Let your creativity guide you.
Try asking:
In What ways might I revitalise my teaching profession?
How Might I teach in uncommon ways?
What might all be the ways to Teach?
Go for Quantity, connect, seek novelty & defer judgment:
List down atleast 25 ideas. Try listing the ideas irrespective of whether they may work, you like them, breaking existing rules.
Narrow down:
After listing 25 or more ideas, then sit with each idea for a moment, and see if they are interesting, something you want to work on, even a bit of possibility is there to make it come true… Only 5 or 6 ideas will remain.
Squeeze the Idea:
Take those ideas, and ask the Who, What, Where, When, Why and How question on those ideas. In this way, you can make any thing that you do into phenomenal activity.
Continue in this path, and I am sure in next 5 years, you will be a very different teacher, with a phenomenal growth and experience."

Ha ha. Before 10 years I would laugh at myself for saying this. After experiencing travels, visiting places, meeting friends, loosing loved ones, being with family members, earning money that can bring luxury, loosing money, getting betrayed by family… after all this one thing that stayed with me and that is the WORK
So expect to balance work that gives you life with life itself. I am not claiming to work all day. I am asking to think work as fuel of your life. Work as a force that makes you believe in you. Work that brings self confidence and increases your creative energy and self esteem. Work as a means to generate self love.
Biggest example is the media. You see the actors who perform so well that you forget they are actors. They create worlds that are so unreal in our reality because they work deligently. The message that you and me, as children of reality have to look at the work they have done.
There are many ways to convince, myriad of points to show, and there is aspect of organization exploiting the workers making them work long hours. Think what is the alternative… Then come with the possiblity that it will have lesser work. I doubt, unless you ask robots to take over… not a good sign eh??
Again, work and life are inseparable. Have a great work day. Cherish your life and love it. Good day"

Then share your vision out with friends n family. See the reaction and start getting inputs. The more you think about the future the present will look as opportunity and place to create that future. If there are small setbacks in present, you look at the longer vision and give attention to it.

This is where becoming master of many trades becomes an issue. We don’t master something to become a millionaires.
You are already blessed master of many trades, think about it. It is a mindset.
What is the definition of a Master? A person who has achieved the ability to do a task without thinking about it. Which is to do it subconsciously, without expending conscious effort from your brain. Metaphorically, to do the task with his eyes closed.
Do you Jog or Swim? Then you are a master of breathing and moving your body in the way you want. Do you feel elated or happy, when you can jog / swim without expending any effort to breath? Then you are one level above the master.
In Ancient India, it is espoused that every learned man or woman has to be a master of 64 skills. You heard me right, 64. There were prince and princesses who were in fact skilled in all 64. No, there was no need of youtube channel or facebook to show their skill. They did not learn to make money or earn a living. They learnt for sake getting mastery over their mind, body and the surrounding.
So What changed? Here is what happened.
Mastering is a internal process, which has been recently moved outside of human body as the technology started growing beyond the reach of our brain or mind.
This is because, mathematics dominates the realm of technology. Mathematics is a study of pattern and shapes of pattern at the basic level. Our brain too is skilled in seeing patterns, learning about them and falling in a comfortable rhythm. Distinction is, our brain doesn’t try to model those patterns into numbers or formulae that can be used in the technology or program the computer. Also we lack the thinking of probability
When you try to master a new technology or skill that is external or , you are augumenting your brain to learn a new set of patterns. You are also trying to understand those patterns and remember them. This is act of understanding and remembering consciously is not our strong point. That is why, many claim that it is not possible to be master of many trades.
So what can we do about it?
To master the ability to have long term perspective in time and space is the ultimate game changer for us. What I mean by perspective? Simple. Ability to see yourself from a detached position, as if hovering above your shoulder, as you do the task. Tricky, not really. Once you master it, then you can really master any trade you want.
I hope a sliver of curiosity and surprise has been registered in your mind. Take a step further, and make the choices that can expand your perspective by a day, a month, an year and a decade. It is an exhilerating experience, like swimming in space time.

Code should flow from your fingers the moment you feel that you understand a problem. I have been proponent of Mastery and being in Zen like Flow. Meditation and Problem Solving are two places out of many, where you can be in such a state of flow.
There are two ways of solving the problem, one is using the closed form equation(Wave Equation for example), and another is using Algorithmic process(Gradient Descent that is used extensively). When you solve real world problems, it is always using Algorithms. We might use closed form equations in some steps.
Take simple physics problems and try coding them, plotting the equations. Use Sympy library, along with Matplotlib. Start playing around with python visualisation, and sympy algebraic solvers. There are couple of books that talk of simulating physics, math and real world problem with python (search for them in google, here I am unable to share). Solve the exercise in those books. (I am a mechanical engineer by training, and it is exhilarating feeling to see the problems getting solved and test cases pass)
The business problems out there need multiple conditions to be checked, and finally decisions to be made. So the main objective of Data Science is to solve countless problems and find these conditions. That too repetitively, at high speed and using available resources. Coding is the only way."
2,https://www.quora.com/In-the-NLP-problem-if-the-training-accuracy-is-94-and-the-test-is-85-is-it-considered-overfitting/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,12,–,www.quora.com,In-the-NLP-problem-if-the-training-accuracy-is-94-and-the-test-is-85-is-it-considered-overfitting,"Accuracy is used in Classification problem, and in NLP, the classification algorithms are used in many situations. Whether to categorize a data as positive or negative like Spam or Not Spam. Or to divide the given data into arbitrary categories like identifying the part of essay.
The objective of the ML is not the “Correct Answer”, that is accuracy. Objective of ML is to “Fit” the model close enough. (If there was a way to get the correct answer, using closed form equations is better than ML. This is one of the reasons, why I started learning problem solving and competitive coding on online judges platform. It helps you reason logically about the answer provided by the ML model. Most of the times, you have to use additional problem solving on top of ML.)
Take the following example. ML model will create an equation, which tries to catch as much correct answers as possible in the given dataset. Lets take a small visualisation exercise…
The equation is in the order of power 5, and the curve it traces is very non-linear. We can intuitively say that, most of the training data has been fitted perfectly by the model. (Model will have low bias, high variance). That is overfitting.
The test data will not fit in the pattern defined by the equation. So the testing accuracy reduces drastically, compared to training accuracy. In terms of lay man, the model is not generalizing for the natural data that is created. In these cases, it is better to refer Recall and Precision, rather than using accuracy.
Recall measures what fraction of True Positives the model predicts correctly(Tp /Tp + Fn). Precision measures how accurate the positive predictions are(Tp/ Tp + Fp). That by itself says a lot about the model that is trained.
When your model is being trained, it is given a error or loss function which it needs to minimize. The lesser the error, better the fit. Model continues reducing the loss every epoch, and after a particular level of loss, the accuracy of the test data starts reducing while training data accuracy is increasing. Which means, as the model is training it is overfitting the data.
There are some solutions for this condition.
The objective of the ML as highlighted already is not correct answer, but to find insights into the data. To explain how certain features have effect on the final outcome. Like in doing Real Science Experiments. Some of these experiments can lead to laws like Newton’s laws of physics, and other will lead to models like the weather prediction models that we have today."
4,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-learning-to-code-change-your-life/answer/Kamal-Raj-17,21,–,www.quora.com,Why-can-learning-to-code-change-your-life,"Try coding one simplest program on a competitive programming platform like DMOJ. You will understand how life changing it can be. You will know everything about the logic, the syntax will be correct, the code you have typed will be prefect and yet two or three test cases fail.
Hours together is spent to not solve the problem but to learn the problem and take care of every mode of failure that you program can undergo. When you spend that muh time and get the solution correct, means the solution will for sure work in real world. That is how real world excellent programs are written. Excellent programmers can become good leaders, solely for their logical thinking and their thoroughness.
Many who intuitively solve the problem think such level of detail is unwanted. when their solution fails in real world they blame the nature or others.Seldom do they hold themselves responsible. They loose their credibility, get demoted and even loose their jobs.
I have been one of those intuitive thinkers. Now with training in programming I realise how important is Logic along with knowledge about the world and the subject. In fact the subject knowledge is useful to test the program than actually programming. Only the expert can come up with extremely rare test cases because he experienced it. But by persevering with the problem, the programmer can imagine test cases that might create problem and work for the same much before the problem happens.
We are programming in real life at many places. At our work, in our kitchen, with our family and friends. Most of the time we struggle because we missed one important point that comes and haunts us back. With programming, you will force yourself to slowdown. Think through the problem inside out. Those who think logically in these these places will progress faster and more easily.
There are downsides too but they are not logically valid downsides. Like overthinking, laziness and unwanted negative biases. These are there whether you one thinks through the problem or not. Problem solving is more profitable than thinking that solving the problem might lead to new problems. (You see illogic in our biases and negative thinking)
When you ask the question, whether it is Logical? Then your brain automatically compartmentalises the problems that you have and the problem you are working on. Have a great time gaining problem solving skills."

It is important to have a political philosophy first. The odds are 7 in 10 that you are in the late teens, because the interest in politics start during that age. You want to influence something that is outside you.
If you learn political philosophy at this age, and get the mindset to contribute to the society, it is a great opportunity. An opportunity to contribute and administer. An opportunity to serve.
If you chose the other route of politicking to profit for yourself, then your imagination is enough. Since the self-enriching political thinking is in-built in to our psyche. In simple words, we are all selfish. We will do many things unimaginable to satisfy ourself. You are your own teacher in this Politics.
So decide which route you want to take, then decide which philosophy you want to side with in your life. Choosing the wrong philosophy can equally ruin your life, like drinking poison. Hence be wary of many ideas that are circulating through the media, books, movie and even songs.
After the above two decision then you are set for life. Really, because the philosophy can be all consuming. Try watching the Harvard course on Political Philosophy in Youtube. You will immediately connect with the ideas in that course.
Have a fabulous life ahead."

Once you have that, and master it the world will be seen in weeks, months, years and decades. It is confusing at first, until you take a goal and think about its time horizon. Some activity or goals can be achieved in a moments notice like buying a book or getting a new gadget.
Then there are goals that will take time. To master engineering, learning to swim, profieciency in a new language. We need to give a longer time in weeks to years.
Then comes changing your character, personality, experiences, loving oneself and your stature in the society. These will take decades. These visions are concrete and stable to large extent. Money, fames, attention and attractive relationships are achieved in similar manner however they vanish without a moment notice. These are false visions.
Now think about this for your job, business, family and life as a whole. This kind of thinking is what makes the difference. This is a skill that is mother of other skills. Master it and then you dont need a master."

To draw the reality and freeze it on a frame is a skill that is much sought after. In reading Leonardo Da Vinci Biography, in which there are couple of pithy advices that I came across.
Be curious and observe the nature around you every moment
Your skill as artist is equivalent to how elegantly you can make a 3d object on a 2d plane of the canvas
Nature has no sharp lines
Shadows are your friend when you want to make the object stand out on canvas.
Learn how shadows change and interact with colour
Learn how the human eyes work
Learn the laws of Perspective and how light impinges on surfaces
Learn the proportions of human body not just in rest, but in motion
Take a notebook always with you to draw the humans in their own environment, doing things animatedly
Mix your interest in art and science to understand the world better.

Understand the major USP of any business school. It gives you a learning environment that is fast paced, collaborative, course work that brings you upto speed on envisioning future, tech, strategy and everyday business tactics. Along with this it shares an alumni that becomes available to you once you leave the school. But you have to do the grunt work and make a name for yourself.
MBA and Driving school an analogy:
It is like going to driving school and learn driving. You get a place with all levels of roads, difficulties and get a group of like minded people around you learning to drive. Then you are licensed by that school, that you are good at driving, in this case driving a business or a part of it.
Trading Time for.Money
The above method is costly but very useful to fast track your life. In that process you get indebted to banks that have anticipated such a demand in us to fast track. I am not saying that MBA schools are not required and should not be joined. On the contrary, you should join the MBA if you are really having vision for your life and know that taking the course will help you in that.
Now think about the other way of getting all the above by yourself. Two things are going to be spent, one is your time and another is your energy.
Why I say time?
Think about the course work you have to search and learn, the evenings after work you learn about business frameworks, weekends that you spend honing your communication skills through toastmaster or dale carnegie classes.
Why I say energy?
To find the books and people to work with will need energy more.than time. Being creative in practicing what you learn again is a major energy consuming process. Also the failures that you face in real life with your own money, energy and time requires you to be a strong character and personality.
Think about these points and then take a decision that is very long term oriented. After all you are gonna live atleast 90 years, so why hurry is my thinking. There are others who ask, why not hurry, because every other tom, dick and harry is choosing MBA route and becoming prosperous. They will have a family that leaves a legacy behind, right?
Set your vision
But what you want with your life and why you want it? Answer that and then your decision will be easier. Have a wonderful future."

Technology so advanced looks like magic to the primitive apes, so you are partly correct in asking whether our egon is united with another form of stability.
Tech itself is simply a recognition of a pattern in reality and trying to solve it by invented laws of nature. So again attention to detail matters. Planning can not be unmasked

Here is what I will do.
I will have deep knowledge of the product I want to sell
I will keenly observe and learn more deeply how customers use it. What challenges they face.
Next i will work on building a team for approaching the customers who have the problem they want to solve. Again here to I observe whether they want to solve it in the first place and pay for it. If not there is no business.
Never do something you are good at for free. Even if you volunteer ensure you learn about the people and the problem they are fascing. Like I volunteer to answer questions in quora, so I can learn the challenges faced by many people.
I will show enthusiasm and eagerness to the customer and try genuinely solve the problem. I will pull the team inside my company to solve the problem.
I will hone my solving skills of working with the customer and my team at the same time. This interpersonal skill is the difference between a person who can grow and not grow a business.
Whether you are a chief executive or a worker on the shop floor the intention has to be in providing solutions. Then the business will grow.
Summary: Keen observation, Drive to grow, Intention to solve, interpersonal skills and ingenious way of creating a better future. All these makes a business grow. If not there, then business stops growing and dies."

Horizon you want to see is the effect. Start with the effect that you want.
The practical way of seeing new horizon is knowing yourself as Sun Tzu says even today. Take heed of his words then instead of just seeing the horizon you can create them. To know yourself, start with questions.
Learn to ask open ended question to yourself and the world around you. Then seek the answers through experience, observation and experiments. This is how everyone can see the Horizon and expand it.
I used to say that life we are living today, benefits we are enjoying today are horizon that someone set for themselves. Ask yourself what kind of life you want to lead? Where you would live and among what kind of people you will work?

To learn kanji, it will take more times and practice. While reading and writing kana will come in a week or so. Practice is the code.
Japanese has a lot of resources on the internet. Literally GBs of data and immense research information is available.Also there are lot teachers and students learning Japanese too. Based on these it is better to go for japanese.
Work opportunities: More Japanese companies are trying to enter and benefit from india growth story.
I have first hand experience with Japanese company for past 6 years and learnt japanese for JLPT and gave N5 and N4. Yep failed in N3, it needs more dedication and it was bit tough. Now I am again working towards passing it.
I have worked with Korean companies too and there are also similar opportunites. I have not learnt Korean but worked with Korean expats. I felt Japanese are bit more traditional and by the book, while Koreans are more sophisticated and risk taking. Japanese are methodical in following the business framework and so are Koreans. Both are very similar when running business but Japanese have a longer vision. This is important for any indian trying to breaking into the companies.
Conclusion: I have not given any information on korean language here. So find the information about the ease of learning and practicing it. Then list down the pro, con and your inclination to pick up a language. Language need not be used only for making money, you can enjoy the literature and make new friends and opportunities.

The answer is your amygdala. The reptile brain inside our human brain. All the logic and reason was a very recent development for the bipeds before that, the life depended on snap judgement. Amygdala helped with that efficiently and got our ancestors to survive.
Thanks to it today we are here to ask questions about emotions. Along came many mutations as our ancestors procreated (had lot of sex because of same amygdala) and which lead to creation of the limbic brain to cover amygdala and its close relations the thalamus pair and hyppocampus. On top of limbic system came cerebral brain which is mostly used for talking, planning, cooperation and long term thinking.
Much research is done to wean us humans of this pesky emotions. Science pure science. you may read lot of novels and see movies where the villain or protagonist is emotionless. To my knowledge we are no where close to achieving it. I really love to be a emotional animal than a machine like Spock,🤣🤣

Gathering theory knowledge is very simple through the various books. Then you can take updated PM courses in Udemy or Coursera. After that do some case studies of the existing apps and products to hone the skills.

Also the solutions to these problems have to be viable, usable, feasible and finally provide value to the person having problem. Then only the customers would pay for it.
Next decision to make is the money you can charge for the solutions. The more you can charge, more people have the problem and easily you can automate the solutions the startup will have best returns. Google is the best example and so is quora.
Product managers all around the world look for solutions that solve the problems that are subtle and seems not required to be solved. For example today all experts are reachable at a click and still it we have to build rapport, trust each other before we enter into any cooperative activity. Can this be solved?
A platform for lawyers and the those who want solutions could be an example solution. Will lawyers want such platform or will the users trust the lawyers? It might already be there, I have not researched this idea as I right. You get the idea.
The best startup or solution is found by the Build, Measure and Learn cycle of development. The art of observing how the customer reacts with your product or service will tell you lot more than your own intuition. This cycle will shorten the losses or risk that any development has.
Be ready to pivot if the solution is not required or doesn't pay. Your role as founder or innovator is to work on reducing the risk and providing a solution that is pays for itself and makes money to pay your bills.
It is fascinating out there, just explore and you will find myriad problems and infinite solutions. Have a phenomenal time developing your startup."

Ask why you want to study? What outcome are you expecting once you study and achieve mastery in what you are studying.
You might want to study to become financially free, or to do a task more easily or speak a language more fluently. Even you could be learning to love yourself more deeply so you could be revitalised in body, mind and spirit.
The outcome is the effect of doing something. When you learn a language, your imaginable outcome could be, a possibility of a great job or your freedom to travel new country, even to meet new people and lead a phenomenal life. You have to focus on the outcome always to stay motivated. Feel how you will feel when your imagined outcome becomes a reality…
One way to increase your learning is to use the time you are walking. Use audio book on your phone while walking. Make use of your mornings to learn atleast for 30 mins. Like this search your day where you can learn..

We all get inspired by characters that we come across. Sherlock and R.Daneel Olivaw were two such characters that has inspired me to learn about mind, math and meditation. These characters opened up new vistas in my life.
Remarkable situations in life can bring turning points, and one such happened last year. I sailed through a very sad and heart breaking experience. Even reading viktor frankl’s “Man’s search of Meaning” was not enough. It had to be book of joy and fearless heart, that showed the ways to really change and shift my perspectives.
So I would say, read more book. It could be on mathematics or a biography. It could be on tantric sex or increasing longevity of life. Like friends who may lead you astray and those who guide you right, the books can show who you really are. Give your time, atleast 30 mins a day and read.

To make and sell stuff is is not the only reason, why one has to work day and night. Challenging part is really to find, why, how, and when to make and sell these stuffs. It is fascinating to learn about your fellow humans with whom you share the world. If you observe them, you will see pattern in everything they do. Even the way I answer, you can find pattern. Learning is nothing but finding the pattern.
Why find these patterns you ask? Because, you can predict what will happen in the future. How about having a time machine inside your own brain… That is what you get when you find a pattern. It takes lot of time to learn the patterns.
Even after learning the pattern, more time is spend in logically deciding which pattern will predict the future. Because most of the time, our fellow humans make mistakes and lie. I am sure, you have experienced that your classmates, even your friends lie to you. One of the strategy to circumvent lying and mistakes is to observe them in prolonged duration in various situation. You will eventually find a pattern.
When you find these patterns, then you can understand what problems they are facing. You can find a solution for them, for which they will pay. We humans want everything like magic, technology today equals to magic, yet want it at lowest cost.
You get the whole idea… The more you delve into your question, and search for the answers, you will understand that inorder to make anything takes a lot of time. Try creating a simple art of boy playing with his friend on a beach on a sunny day, where the big ships are harbored at a distance. Add birds flying above them.

This WHAT is not something materialistic. It is something that resonates with you deeply. The why it is not just pure reason but backed with strong intuition that reinforces why you want that one goal that you are seeking.
Take a moment and see inside yourself, what is that you value deeply at bottom of your heart? Is it happiness, livelihood, growing consciousness, could be something that you want… work toward it.

Decouple the skill attainment from the work. Approach the challenges by simplifying them. Lets take work creation first.
What is Work?
Work is a lifeblood of human beings. work they choose will define their purpose and perspective in life. We rarely see any way to achieve our life goals without work. However many forget that having a work that is rewarding and fulfilling itself a very important goal.
Do stable professions exist?
Stable professions may not be rewarding for everyone. We can see evidence all around us in the way of theft, mis handling of responsiblity, power politics and so on. Humans always seek power any where they go after they stabilise, it is in our DNA and harmones. If our goal is to survive peacefully, we have to manage this challenge first. Then, providing stable jobs will come.
How work n workers defined?
Work is defined by the skills, vision and the culture of the organization. While a job seeker is defined by his skills and vision. The missing link is the culture n vision in job seeker.
Are there organisation that helps the youth to create their vision?
No. Think which is more challenging, skill development or culture development. We as a country need to create organization which instills culture and vision in the growing job seekers which can then be matched with the companies. Schools and colleges are factory for churning out workers with skills and certifiying their skill level. But the vision of those individuals are crushed by that process.
How to solve the challenges of rural youth?
Stable income has to be provided by the government or a non profit. Ensure that youth are training to get a vision. They are given an environment to try out their vision and see if they love it. And then let loose on the world. It is similar to how early philosophers thought about grooming the politicians.
How will government or the organization subsidise the youth?
This is a big question that you are really asking. No one person can come up with a single answer. Lives have to be spent on changing the current scenario.

The five year olds are more curious about learning how the world works around them by touching, licking and feeling them.
Try showing them the patterns in the tables say two tables will go like,
2 4 6 8 …
Three tables go like
3 6 9 12..
Four
4 8 12 16
You get the idea. Once the kid sees the pattern, his mind will predict what comes next. Then learning tables thru school becomes super easy. Atleast that is my belief.
Vedic math is also based on the pattern recognition and finding different tactics.
On top of learning pattern, learning to add vedic method will help as the kids grow. But that is not for 5 year olds, let them have fun some more years before they sit on their bums and start calculating."

I am building knowledge and experience in managing projects that are longer than a year, even though it is a simple product. Leading a team that is short term oriented, and showing it big picture and pushing them forward is a joyful journey.

Men love themselves more when they are with what they love the most, have achieved, strived to attain in their life. Does your man love himself? Can you see him happy, and making those around him happy? Is he caring towards you? If you answer yes to one of the above question, then it is time you loved him more.
Men usually distance themselves when they are facing some challenge and they want to solve it themselves. That is how we are made, and no we are not showing our independence. Men are designed in such a foolish blueprint, which was useful in prehistoric times. We distance ourselves and then come closer when we have resolved the issue.
Finally men seek solution and want to maintain the current good condition. Not change and try something new. If your guy is reluctant in this aspect, then try to cajole him and be patient.

Unfortunately, men don’t understand this. You can see this in a mother. She loves her husband, and his mom and dad diffrently. A girl friend loves her male friends and his boyfriend differently. The change in pattern is very subtle.
It takes lot of discipline for men to see this in their girl friends and their partners. Challenge for women is, the male friends who they are in contact can change shades and influence women in giving something they should not to give. So the men who trusts the women have high probability of feeling cheated.

What are you going to do with all the money you earn? First answer that. Using the money to experience the reality is very important.
Being a platform for the businesses themselves will be the easiest way to make more money. Like Google, Alibaba, Amazon etc, who are now platform that connects the customers to the suppliers. They are a brand, which acts as an intermediary, getting all the data from both sides of the sale.
Franchising the existing brands that sell products and services that people cannot live without is the next in line. If you want to make money, then start your own new franchise/ brand and build it to sell them. You need to be disciplined/ talented/ hard work to build it.
If you are starting out, then buying a franchise is like a house, that will provide you returns, experience of running business and contacts that you will need when you move out on your own.
Coffee shops, Burger joints, Pizza parlours, Bakeries and even car washes have got their franchises. If you love personal care related services, like hair saloon, cosmetic upgrades, even there is franchises for that. There goes, you can buy franchise or create franchise depending on your expertise
Stock Market : Trading or Investing in stocks are a very viable business if you are having idea of competitive edge.
The competitive edge is created after you have found a problem pattern, or stock price pattern. You can see the fish in the above pattern, and see that it is going upwards. You can take a bet that, it is will move up for atleast some more time. Based on that you take the stand as either buyer or seller in the market. It is a very deep subject, and requires time and skill to learn.
Consulting : Business
is based on making other business better with your expetise on the process, knowledge, strategic ideas, best practices and contacts. This is one of the low money investment high returns business.
One can do it either working for a big organisation, or working solo. Having prior work experience will help in moving this direction. There are tomes of books about this topic.
The money made depends on the energy and time you spend on any of the above businesses. Identifying a problem or need that requires a solution, or showing that there is a problem and solving it requires time. Take your time and learn more about them.
Hope you are putting some of these ideas to work. Because the moment it works others will already be competing for your profit. There is a pattern in the need of humans. It raises and falls erratically. Have a fun time catching the wave.
What skills:
Decision making,
Ability to discover the needs and wants of the customer,
Ability to find innovative way of getting money from the customers,
Ability to create a vision, mission and goals for your company,

I was delighted to find answers that were positive and challenging at the same time. I wished to see a more big picture kind of answer, and thought I must throw some light.
Google is a platform for those who want information for fulfilling their wants, needs, inspirations. Other side of the platform is those who want to share information, for meeting their wants, needs and inspirations. Google has come up with a elegant solution, win/win/win for Google, the info seekers and info providers.
Cut Search Competition
Google has built its infrastructure for profit, there is no doubt. They are shrewd and smart business people. Ideas and creativity are life blood of this company. Reading In the Plex and Trillion Dollar Coach, showed me how the bread and butter of the google business model was established. Following that The four horsemen, book on Amazon, Apple, Google and FB showed how each are eating themselves, and brink of going extinct. Funny, but that is the reality.
Big Picture
Among all these competition, and internal challenges the company is growing rapidly and doing well as of today. What will be Google after 50 years? Will they be a Search Engine giant or something different? How will we navigate the world at that time? Why will someone live and try to prosper, when he has everything he needs at his finger tips always?
Powered by Google
Maps, Search, Mail, Video streaming, Cloud storage and processing are something Google offers seamlessly to 3.5 billion smartphones, 2.5 billion computers world wide these services, through the network infrastructure built by many organisations. The livelihood of businesses, employees and even government depends on these services. (Think of a government giving mail service for free!!!). I know other companies like Yahoo, Amazon, Duck Duck Go and even FB will have the services available for free. The point I am making is the effort that had gone into build these products are mind bogling.
The effort to observe what a customer needs and fulfill that exactly, is a great art, I will miss. They have been doing this through discipline and process, and not just by hit and trial. I realized this, when I took the product manager course recently.
Torch Bearers of Web
Whether I miss Google or not, I will miss the engineers, the tech experts and importantly the senior leaders who navigated the tough environment to build this company. I am sure, somewhere in this world another Google is being made. They are having better engineers, more nimbler products and phenomenal growth capabilities. Still, I will love google for they showed the light in the forest of internet era.
Kudos to Google Engineers, Managers, Tech guys and Administrators."

I tried and did well in manage a online evaluation contest in the Toastmaster club. It might seem simple to think about meetings since we do them everyday with out colleagues. However managing a contest was a unique experience. It showed me places where I can improve my coordination.
I tried and succeeded in driving down from New Delhi to Coimbatore in my Jeep, that is total of 2600 km in 41 hrs. Not straight though, I took breaks after every 900 km. It has given me confidence that I can take on bigger challenges.
I tried to learn about the job market, and how to improve our chances of getting the job that we want. The idea of using ikigai and matching your skills to what the job needs is a real eye opener.
I am learning about product management through Udemy. Till now it has shown me so many new concepts when it comes to bringing new product or services to market.
More importantly thing that I am trying and succeeding is doing the prayer of Happiness. I got the idea from Book of Joy. This is how it goes
May I/loved ones/all beings be free from suffering and its causes
May I/loved ones/all beings attain happiness and its causes
May I/loved ones/all beings never be separated from joy that is free from misery
May I/loved ones/all beings abide in equanimity that is free of attached and aversion
Happiness is a skill to be learnt and it is the purpose of a human life. A very simple and profound knowledge that makes my day a breeze to live.I am greatful to have my friends and family, even the whole world to share my life. That is one reason I joined quora and started sharing my wisdom and ideas
Finally I started listening to very soothing guided meditation tracks by Purely Lucy. A phenomenal change in attitude, faith, vibrations around me started happening. Ability to forgive and ability to move in life with love and ease increased.

Some of the social and behavioral cues that team members observe when they are together is lost. This loss in information has lead to additional work for many. They have to do additional follow ups and coordination when the things don’t move as per the plan.
We have highlighted the challenge of communication. Then there is challenge of team members slacking in the work. Many have taken work from home has a vacation, and started enjoying with the family or in some cases even forced to be with the family. This causes others to take up the slack and complete the work.
Work is a jigsaw puzzle to begin with. Everyone is trying to solve a problem of each other and we are getting paid for that. In to this, a new challenge is added, that is to work away from office, where the environment, the motivation and the urgency is felt. When at home, the same urgency cannot be felt by every team member. The feeling or need to solve a problem gets postponed at times, leading to built up of back log.
Once the problems have piled up, then bringing order among the problems itself becomes a challenge. Some team members can get so overwhelmed, their entire load may be transferred to others.
Even though the work from home has increased our work, we can still reduce it by really taking care of each of our team members. We are more of a team, the entire world of brothers and sisters are working towards making the world a place of happiness and prosperity. Keeping this in mind at every decision we take, the work on each other can be reduced and wealth can be created.
Have a fun and happy life…"

What are you going to do with all the money you earn? First answer that. Using the money to experience the reality is very important.
Being a platform for the businesses themselves will be the easiest way to make more money. Like Google, Alibaba, Amazon etc, who are now platform that connects the customers to the suppliers. They are a brand, which acts as an intermediary, getting all the data from both sides of the sale.
Franchising the existing brands that sell products and services that people cannot live without is the next in line. If you want to make money, then start your own new franchise/ brand and build it to sell them. You need to be disciplined/ talented/ hard work to build it.
If you are starting out, then buying a franchise is like a house, that will provide you returns, experience of running business and contacts that you will need when you move out on your own.
Coffee shops, Burger joints, Pizza parlours, Bakeries and even car washes have got their franchises. If you love personal care related services, like hair saloon, cosmetic upgrades, even there is franchises for that. There goes, you can buy franchise or create franchise depending on your expertise
Stock Market : Trading or Investing in stocks are a very viable business if you are having idea of competitive edge.
The competitive edge is created after you have found a problem pattern, or stock price pattern. You can see the fish in the above pattern, and see that it is going upwards. You can take a bet that, it is will move up for atleast some more time. Based on that you take the stand as either buyer or seller in the market. It is a very deep subject, and requires time and skill to learn.
Consulting : Business
is based on making other business better with your expetise on the process, knowledge, strategic ideas, best practices and contacts. This is one of the low money investment high returns business.
One can do it either working for a big organisation, or working solo. Having prior work experience will help in moving this direction. There are tomes of books about this topic.
The money made depends on the energy and time you spend on any of the above businesses. Identifying a problem or need that requires a solution, or showing that there is a problem and solving it requires time. Take your time and learn more about them.
Hope you are putting some of these ideas to work. Because the moment it works others will already be competing for your profit. There is a pattern in the need of humans. It raises and falls erratically. Have a fun time catching the wave."

Wealth is measured in the discretionary time one has in his life, and enjoying everything he wants. If you are looking for wealth, then you are going to create that in abundance, if you start business.
Take a look at various business you can start or enter into, hereKamal Raj's answer to What business or career is best if the only goal is to make as much money as possible (businesses to start, jobs to pursue, skills to learn)?
Humans love to build something to say their name, call it vanity or happiness in bringing the creativity to life or simply to feel the adrenaline course through the pre-historic brain. Business is one such building, that will give the fame, fierceness and fan his creativity.
Whether it is a corner store, doing busy turnover in simple breads or having multi-billion dollar assets slosshing in the balance sheets, and bank accounts there is wealth created. Take heed to the voice that is screaming at you, right now. Here is one more important idea to nail in my argument.
When you are young, single, living under parents house there is not much expenditure for yourself. Parents these days can afford to let their wards to take on risks after they complete under grad colleges, and learn something practical in doing the business.
The challenge it seems, is rudderless minds of the youngsters. If you are having a goal, that is to create wealth and use it get discretionary time. Then go all the way, and have a fun time running your own business. You will be unsinkable… rather unconquerable."

I am curious to know how the world works, or I am searching for inspiration. Could be a new challenge in life. Want to help dear ones who are facing some trouble. To get a better job….The list will prolonged as I introspected sitting there with this question. Then I learnt something about myself from the pattern I saw in my answers.
I love myself when I learn something and love to help those around me. One of the 1st benefits of learning everyday, it helps you to love yourself.
It might seem altruistic to look from the point of my loved ones, it cannot be any farther from complete selfishness. I had learnt that being selfish, loving oneself, claiming happiness is the foremost step towards learning new things. World is expressed in most complex and beautiful way possible.
Learning it gives a sense of achievement and power to predict what might happen next. Predicting our future makes us feel more secure and confident. In the wilderness, our ancestor used all his senses along with instinct to learn his environment, so we are here today to learn more. Second benefit is, learning keeps us alive
Mind is a concept that outside our brain, while our brain senses the thoughts and ideas that are fleeting inside the mind. We have control over the brain, with our food, exercise, and the nourishment we take. Learning about how to use the brain, what makes it move in to flow, why it likes to be happy and safe, leads us to learn more.
3rd Benefit is learning provides us the warmth and excitement that provides motivation even on a day that is as dull as a rainy, snowy day in autumn. It is like mug of hot chocolate warmed up, and given to you in your cozy bed filled with colors and scents. Add to that wonderful conversations with friends and family. That is what learning is all about.
Triple benefits of learning is to be happy, alive and be excited. We all want excitement every day in our life, live it happily and be alive. Learn something new today, whip open your favorite book, click on that new course, pick up that new hobby.. Chop Chop… Have a fun day"

Being happy is the soul purpose of life, and practicing happiness is part of loving yourself. Accepting the way you are, embody humilty and humour, readily forgive, change perspective when struck in a connundrum, being compassionate, having gratitude and showing generosity, are the ways to joy and happiness.
Every discipline needs a Goal. Attract the Goal rather than setting a goal by yourself. Aim for achieving mastery in the subject that chooses you. Realise that school or college is place to truly find your passion, get clarity and infuse discipline. Mind can bring any idea to life, like a fertile land. When you plant the seeds, some will take hold and grow, nurture and nourish those goals with all your attention and are.
Discipline has to practiced in many areas of life. Exercise daily, atleast go for a jog in the morning. It helps to release Endorphins on of the important harmone. Even playing for hobby will do. More you can control your body, with your mind higher the self-confidence and faith in yourself. When you achieve small goals like jogging for 10 mins, making your abs flat etc can release dopamine, another good harmone. These all help in-directly to the studies. That is why, schools have play time included, and value extra curricular activities.
Mind is the starting point. Move your mind to self-awareness mode, and improve your self-esteem. Self-esteem is achieved through practice, and having a happy mindset. There are some strategies shared above with help of exercise to improved self-esteem. Another way is use Meditation, and increase your self-awareness.
Discipline starts with attention.Attention comes from the energy that you have. Energy comes from the food and drinks that you consume. Energy has to be high all through the day, so you can learn and retain. Also prolonged attention can be improved with self-awareness, which is again trained by meditation.
Taking breaks regularly from the grind is another important requirement. Using the weekends to reach out friends and having fun lunch, or visit local park and having a coffee etc can rejuvenate your mind. When you share the challenges you are facing with someone close to you, who is non-judgemental, lends you their ears can be very refreshing. When you air your challenges, you will find solution, and understand concepts much easily.
It is seldom one activity or input that achieves the desired results, when it comes to human behavior and improvement.

The coordination was done between three different technical centers located in Japan, China and India. Customers were located in Americas, Europe and Asia.
Before having a meeting, communicate the agenda of the meeting and use the mail communication to begin the meeting
Use Excel / Presentation software on the screen sharing mode to list down the various conclusions that are being discussed. This might be a challenge at the beginning, but it can be mastered fast
Break down each activity into smaller components, and try to find who is correct resource to solve those activities before communicating. This will avoid mulitple mails or discussions
Use phone calls extensively to follow up on the action points that has been assigned. Whatsapp calls are a life saver. Colleague seems to be right beside you when the call happens.
Have the best earphones, it is an investment that can decide your mindset during a hour long discussions. Having your hands free can help you to come with new ideas by doodling on the paper, or use it to list the action that needs to be taken.
Multiple internet connection by using redundant service providers can help you to be connected, even if one of the service providers malfunction.
Meditate everyday and send love to everyone who is working with you. This helps to have a calm and positive mindset all through the day. Misunderstanding can be resolved easily, and free of frustration and anger.
Learning to actively listen is a skill that is rarely used, when the emotions and conflicting interests bear on a meeting. Being self-aware and interupt only when you have clear question to ask, is the best way to actively listen.
Finally, be jovial and happy all through the day. There can be anxieties, fears and angry moments. Reach out to your loved ones and discuss these frustrations regularly."

Being happy is the soul purpose of life, and practicing happiness is part of loving yourself. Accepting the way you are, embody humilty and humour, readily forgive, change perspective when struck in a connundrum, being compassionate, having gratitude and showing generosity, are the ways to joy and happiness.
Attract the Goal rather than setting a goal by yourself. Aim for achieving mastery in the subject that chooses you. Realise that school or college is place to truly find your passion, get clarity and infuse discipline. Mind can bring any idea to life, like a fertile land. When you plant the seeds, some will take hold and grow, nurture and nourish those goals with all your attention and are.
Exercise daily, atleast go for a jog in the morning. It helps to release Endorphins on of the important harmone. Even playing for hobby will do. More you can control your body, with your mind higher the self-confidence and faith in yourself. When you achieve small goals like jogging for 10 mins, making your abs flat etc can release dopamine, another good harmone. These all help in-directly to the studies. That is why, schools have play time included, and value extra curricular activities.
Move your mind to self-awareness mode, and improve your self-esteem. Self-esteem is achieved through practice, and having a happy mindset. There are some strategies shared above with help of exercise to improved self-esteem. Another way is use Meditation, and increase your self-awareness.
Memory increases proportional to the attention that you give to a particular idea that you learn, concept that you understand or information that you gather.
Attention comes from the energy that you have. Energy comes from the food and drinks that you consume. Energy has to be high all through the day, so you can learn and retain. Also prolonged attention can be improved with self-awareness, which is again trained by meditation.
Taking breaks regularly from the grind is another important requirement. Using the weekends to reach out friends and having fun lunch, or visit local park and having a coffee etc can rejuvenate your mind. When you share the challenges you are facing with someone close to you, who is non-judgemental, lends you their ears can be very refreshing. When you air your challenges, you will find solution, and understand concepts much easily.
It is seldom one activity or input that achieves the desired results, when it comes to human behavior and improvement. To get the necessary score in an exam, achieve a certain status in life, go to certain designation in you job, all need multiple activities, with high level of attention, concentration, discipline, food habits.

Being a platform for the businesses themselves will be the easiest way to make more money. Like Google, Alibaba, Amazon etc, who are now platform that connects the customers to the suppliers. They are a brand, which acts as an intermediary, getting all the data from both sides of the sale.
Franchising the existing brands that sell products and services that people cannot live without is the next in line. If you want to make money, then start your own new franchise/ brand and build it to sell them. You need to be disciplined/ talented/ hard work to build it.
If you are starting out, then buying a franchise is like a house, that will provide you returns, experience of running business and contacts that you will need when you move out on your own.
Coffee shops, Burger joints, Pizza parlours, Bakeries and even car washes have got their franchises. If you love personal care related services, like hair saloon, cosmetic upgrades, even there is franchises for that. There goes, you can buy franchise or create franchise depending on your expertise
Stock Market : Trading or Investing in stocks are a very viable business if you are having idea of competitive edge.
The competitive edge is created after you have found a problem pattern, or stock price pattern. You can see the fish in the above pattern, and see that it is going upwards. You can take a bet that, it is will move up for atleast some more time. Based on that you take the stand as either buyer or seller in the market. It is a very deep subject, and requires time and skill to learn.
Consulting : Business is based on making other business better with your expetise on the process, knowledge, strategic ideas, best practices and contacts. This is one of the low money investment high returns business.
One can do it either working for a big organisation, or working solo. Having prior work experience will help in moving this direction. There are tomes of books about this topic.

Start with the why?
Is it an argument that needs support or an information you are creating awareness about? Depending on that collect supporting points.
Be ready for opposing thoughts arising in listening minds. Do research on points that contradict your views and answer those in your speech.
Every point can be expressed with plain language or imaginable language. Use metaphors and allegory, especially stories to show your points strength.
Steadily build the points towards your central point and finally show how important is for the listening minds to support you. Your points must add to the momentum and finally enter their minds like waterfall falling on the ground.
Then give them time to think after all the splashing and crashing of your points has been completed. Use the pause to let their mind grasp your idea. Take a piercing look at your audience, and strongly believe they are supporting you.
As they are reflecting then you come to start of your speech, and say your cental point again and complete it. The idea is to have the speech to be circular and have a closure too.
Hope this idea helps. Have a wonderful time ahead.

Most importantly having the mind in state of ease thru laughing and joking in the middle of communication is also important.
Smiling or scowling face is more memorable, pleasant emotions will be better palatable. And those faces need not be that of humans like abive. Here I use lots of pictures and allegory to create a connect.
I wrote the point I want to communicate here first. Then I moved in search of the pictures that can make the idea stand in your mind for a longer time.
How much time I must have gone into imagining the pictures? Not much, I had go out to free image websites like pixabay or freepics and search for some pictures using concepts I want to communicate. Do support the artists by atleast citing the source like how I have done here, so others too can support them.

Society is becoming very open and accepting as the concept of same sex like each other.

If you partner subscribes to this idea, then you will have easier time.
If you like girls, go ahead and share it with your partner. You can take up this topic jovially first, and see his reaction. If his reaction is mild, and open minded then you can take further steps clarifying your liking of other girls.
If he doesn’t like your idea, then think, whether your pleasure of being with other girls is more important or your partner’s happiness. Sharing their partners with other guys or girls alike makes guys very upset atleast in the beginning.
Be sure, you both have a very strong bonding and vision to be together. If that is there, you liking other girls will be seen equal to you liking ice cream or spicy food. Nothing more. It is common for girls to like other girls, and have a very intimate sortees too. Have a fun time."

It attracts the loving and cherising thoughts for you capitalise on. Steadily you will start forgeting that you have stage frieght, and start enjoying even looking forward to taking the stage.

Standing in front of the business and seeing how many customers enter for business and how much products they carry can give you a approximate information
Checking the number of salesman in a business is another way to understand how much sales they are making. Though this method can be wrong depending on the business location.
Getting hold of the PnL sheet of the business from the auditior is straightforward way of seeing the revenue.
Connecting with the suppliers of the business and asking them for information can be helpful. It will take time though.
Cold calling the business and ask for information regarding the issues they are facing in the business and trying to help them as a consultant can be very interesting way. This is done after considerable research is done on the business.

Loving yourself will make your alone time a great asset. You will find great books to read, wonderful hobbies to pursue, places that are exotic to visit and simply have a good time. When the paths of others cross yours, steadily your relationship will increase.
That said, you can try Bumble, Tinder, Toastmaster clubs, or joining clubs of your taste and meet new people. The point is to explore new horizons within your reach.
Another strategy is taking a new project in your life. Like improving your health through yoga, meditation, exercise. All these can be done either alone or in a group. Pls beware of cults that form around these kind of self improvement ideas.
Final strategy is that you start a cult or following for yourself. There are so many like you feeling restless and unable to be alone. Reach out to them and provide your support and ideas.

Seems like a silly question? It starts with answering that question. If you have a good reason, or atleast intuition on why you want remember everything that you read, then you will.
Assuming you have good reason or intuition first. Here are some simple tactics you can use.
Anatomy of Attention: Attention is the fuel for the memory. Attention comes from the energy your brain has any moment. Energy is sourced out of the blood that is coursing through your brain. Blood that is full of energy, and not tainted with unwanted harmones can increase your brain efficiency. So the food you eat, the information you assimilate and your state during reading all impact your attention. Why to be such detailed about attention? Because, that is how you remember.
Anatomy of Detail: More you go into the details of anything, the better you can imagine, make pictures out of concepts, attach earlier ideas to it and make it vivid, bring it life by animating in your mind’s theater and keep it there for a long time. Details are possible when you give attention to the present. Not only when you read, when you do anything including breathing. In a single word, you must be self-aware and be in meditative state every waking moment. Having photographic memory, or simply able to remember whatever you see and read is possible when you are self-aware.
Anatomy of Self-awareness: Happiness is the fuel for being self-aware. Moment you are happy, you stay in the present and time flow rapidly. The more you are happy, there is no need to dwell in the past or fantasize the future. So learning the art of happiness is prime to improve your memory. Being kind and loving to yourself is start for meditating and improving your self-awareness.
Hope all these strategies and tactics help you to move wholistically into improving your memory."

To reprogram or train your mind, the only way is to program your brain with its own language.
Brains language is words and pictures. The more vivid pictures the words or thoughts create, better the brain can retain them and get trained. The subconscious brain is a repeater chip which will remember and play the picture again and again endlessly until you reprogram it.
How to do it?
Sit still in a place and try to calm your mind like meditating. Then bring the picture or the action that you want to occur in you. It could be having a great time, feeling connected to your friends, satisfying trips or even wild imagination like flying on a space ship to mars that has been colonised. Hold that thought, go deeper in to the details. Create the situation and the surroundings that you are in. Feel as if you are in that situation.
More the detail stronger the programming will hold in the subconscious brain. After ten to 20 sittings, you will notice that your brain starts thinking more about the idea that you trained it on.
One difference between the fantasies and such imagination is that, you will act upon any opportunity that might arise to make the imagination come true. That action is the difference maker.

Mind is a expansive sensation that our brain has every waking moment. This is sensation is outside our brain. Mind also can be said to be collection of thoughts, ideas and vibrations attached with energy. Some thoughts and ideas have such energy they can attract your attention while others dont.
Brain is a sense and transmitting device. Not a residence of Mind. Mind is outside you, and if you believe this then you can start reading minds. In fact the mind reading course would not be an online course, but a on-mind course. The tutor will connect with the mind and show you the process…
This way of thinking is first step for you to search for knowledge in a different way. Make yourself available then all the minds of this world is yours. Their ideas, wants, insecurities and thoughts are what is happening in your own brain.
If you can read your own mind fearlessly then other minds will open up. Have belief, learn the skill of seeing the ideas and thoughts, be free from fear, suffering, anger and attach energy to your thoughts with attention, love, affection."

I also sometimes think that the person whom we miss are also missing us. Their mind and our mind is somehow connected over long distance. This is possible if you think the mind as something that is outside you and your brain is a way of sensing the mind.
Then your thought of missing them is really not your thought. It is a thought that your brain has picked and it is really the thought of the person whom you missed😅😅. Cant be proved though… some call this telepathy.

Talk to his acquaintances, and do research about him in social networks and through other means. This will show what that person thinks as Important.
When you get an opportunity to introduce yourself, then you can use research information and present yourself as a solution. Some call the first introduction as pitching, and others call it self-marketing. One thing for sure, there is nothing wrong in introducing your strengths and capabilities to a important person."

One of my friend’s mom recently retired from her very active job. After her retirement, she lapsed into self-loathing and laziness steadily. My friend became worried about the situation and decided to change it.
He reassured to his mom, that they loved her irrespective of whether she worked or not. He asked his sister to spend more time with her mother. Once she felt reassured of her families love and started to smile, then he started a kind of routine in her life.
Routine was a simple morning ritual, like watering the in-house plants followed with refreshements and reading a page of a motivational book. Followed with mandatory breakfast with family and so on. After a month of such routine, she herself started new projects and got motivated. Now she is fully taking on new challenges for her family.

Philosophy is an activity which has been done by thinkers for a long time. Questioning the world that you live in, and being curious is other way to learn philosophy. I would suggest to begin by reading the “Children's Book of Philosophy”. It introduces the philosophers and their ideas very precisely. Later you can take courses in Edx and Harvard.
Youtube has political Philosophy course which is so good, that you will get engrossed in it at the first go. Arguments they have is very contraversial, so head to that course with open brain. There are philosophers who are anarcho communists and others who are anarcho capitalists. These extremes have to be learnt as the ideal cases, and not to be thought as reality.
Also philosopher can be Idealists, Realists and Pragmatists. These philosophers put on certain ideas / beliefs as their lens and then see the world. Use your own judgement in assimilating what you read.
Many writers, authors, statesmen and officials have their own philosophy which is a variant of ideals. They add their own ideas on the existing philosophy, like Aristotle who disagreed with Plato. You too can do the same, and come up with something creative.

It means, If you are not there then I cannot love myself and live happily
It is a cliche from the movies, and romantic novels. Which has helped the capitalistic society. Capitalism works because, you want somethings that others have. Instead of loving yourself the way you are. This helps to boost the sales and revenue for the capitalists.
When you love yourself, and become satisfied there is nothing for you to buy or sell. You become happy by just being in this world. Which is counter productive, and will lead to socialistic/ communistic way of living. Which is not good for everyone on the whole. So at this moment, this phrase is helping our economy grow and put food on the plates of countless families. I am glad for that."

In order to find a reason for something, a conscious being has to be creative and hungry. Human survival becomes the biggest reason for many things we do, where no creativity is required.
Once your hunger is satiated, then your reasoning ability starts searching for other reasons to survive. There comes reproduction, dominance, and afterlife. The more you are removed from base reasons and move on to more aesthetic reasons, you start being creative.
In order to be creative, there has to be mind space. You create that by stopping all distractions, like books, movies, and other man made junks. Let the nature give you ideas, that you can put on paper. You might stare at blank paper for hours, and get nothing. Another day, you may not be able to stop writing.
Other way of becoming creative is going on a date with yourself to a new part of a town, and then write about the experience. You will find that, what you saw and what you describe will be sometimes extremely different.
The above two ideas comes from the book, How to think like an artist.
Then you can take a blank paper and start doodling, and learn to draw. Yes, learning to draw can be a one big creative kicker. Because, your brain finds a new way to express itself, and the mind capitulates on this new found skill. That is the reason, why you see people with lot of practice create wonderful creations.

So let me take this business as example. They had customers visiting them all day. In the brief two to three hours I stayed there, there were 5 customers who visted, and all did business with them. Assuming that 10 customers visit per working day, then in a month there will be 200 customers.
Next is the revenue each customer brings. Lets assume the average revenue is 700 INR per customer, then per month revenue is 140,000 INR. Lets assume further that the fixed and variable costs per month is 100,000, so the profit per month is 40,000 INR. There is taxes and the interest payable, so the final cash flow would be different from the actual P&L. (The small business buyer will go in detail, and collect all the above information that I have assumed. He will then compare it with other better / worse performing car wash businesses.)Then you extrapolate it to the entire year, including the cycle of revenue increase and reduction, and improvement of over all business year on year
Based on the number of customer visiting, and the fixed and variable costs spent by the car wash also can be extrapolated. After you have calculated YOY revenue, the cash flow can be calculated and extrapolated. To do this, it is better to get hold of P&L, Balance sheet and Cash flow statements from the auditor of that small business.
Once you have the cash flow for each future year, you can run the NPV (net present value) calculation and add all the NPV. The NPV depends on the Cost of the capital (Interest rate) for you and the Return rate you are expecting. Most business expect 12% returns to begin with.
That is how you arrive at the cost that you can pay for the small business. There are countless books, and blogs out there explaining the same with myriad examples and more in detail. Here I have provided an outline."

Loved ones lie for two reasons. They want to safeguard themselves or they want safeguard their loved ones. If you feel that your brother is safeguarding himself, then you have to go out of the way and make him feel safe. Then he will open up steadily and share the truth. Make him feel secure in your presence.
If he is lying to safeguard you, then it means you are insecure or having strong beliefs in certain matters. He doesn’t want you to be hurt by the truth. He has to be a loving and caring guy for lying like this. So respect him either way.
It is the perspective you choose decides on how you can like your brother. Have a loving life. TC"

He could be shy or uncomfortable. Talk with him, and not just insist him to do it. He might feel excited or aroused when he cuddles with you, and doesnt want to embrass you by doing something more than just cuddling. He might have some past memories surfacing, when he cuddles with you… I mean, there are hundreds of reasons, or just plain intuition.

Companies are nothing but a set of solutions. It is in the benefit of these companies that their employees are entrepreneurial. Let me explain.
Being entrepreneurial means, doing the ground work about the customer they are targeting and their problems. Then the solution that companies can provide is matched with the problems the customers have. More customers like the solution, they spread the word. The company flourishes, and the entrepreneur learns and develops his skill set too.
Each GM, Senior Manager and Manager in an organisation is outward focused to learn from the customer, while the engineers and solution providers focus inwards to fit together the best solutions. I had explained elsewhere, how the companies are like fishing nets, and the customers are the fishes. Only difference, these nets service/ solve the customers’ problems and troubles. Then let them pass to become customers for other companies. This is the abundance mindset. Everyone wins. The Nets and Fishes.
The companies themselves are bigger fishes, which are being served or eaten by the government policy nets. Recent governments have realized the benefits of serving the companies and letting them be there in the ocean. So the countries, their government flourishes. Everyone wins. Abundance mindset.
So there you go, Enterpreneurial employees make a huge difference for a company, country and his own life."

To recall something pleasant, you have to be in a pleasant mood. The more you try to make the mood pleasant, it becomes worse, is it not? The secret is not trying to make it pleasant. Just accept as it is.
It is tough but why to be frustrated more when you are already feeling unpleasant. One important tactic is to share the situation with your loved ones, so you can get a perspective, and feel light at heart. Other way is to look at the impact this situation is going to have on your life after a week, a month, a year.

My project was to increase the number of meeting attendees from 8 members to 16 members. I had very less members to support me, and those who were experienced, were occupied in their own projects. Only new members volunteerend work with me.
I tried to increase the reach of our club through various means. The team who were under me, were trying their best. The outcome was not positive immediately. Many mistakes were happening. There were delay, people falling sick, the world impacted by Covid. All these were happening.
All of a sudden, after an year of working together, I could feel a magic. The team was working in perfect sync. Everyone was doing their activity to the point, and our club reached 16 members after 9 months since I started my project.

Take one new hobby, say to type on keyboard using only left hand, and do it for 10K hours. (You can do that Dvorak Layout in just under 5 hours, I typed this answer only with my right hand while I was drinking hot cup of tea with the other) Still, you can take this challenge, and say that you did not master such left handed typing, and show that this argument is disproved.

First was the insecurity about the job, then about my relationship position, about my friends, then the world view that I was holding.
Insecurity arises when your belief and the reality don’t match. You might think that you are strong, and handsome. Your close friend might like you, and want to spend all her time with you. In your brain, you might still think that friend is not liking you and leave you. This is one of the many examples that I can think off.
Insecurity arises with the thoughts, so training your thoughts to be positive, attractive and filled with love giving energy is important. It takes training in prayer and affirmations to convert the thoughts to be filled with positive energy. I believe that the world is made of love and kindness. World is made for us to be happy and live long. With these beliefs, the insecurities can be managed with sustained training.
I had learnt this through Book Of Joy written by Dalai Lama and Archbishop. It is a wonderful gift those two men have given to us. Read it, and am sure you will find clarity and calmness."

This is intuition based belief. To love something is to show attention to details. Have you fallen in love, and experienced the obsession that comes on the other person? A trade or a skill has to be respected, and loved at the same level.
In philosophy there are two types of knowledge, one is through intuition and other is through reason. Person loves his trade or work so much that he spends more time with it, than with the beloved. Beloved understands this, and still loves the person. It is an intuition that being the best in one trade will make you happy irrespective of how much you earn.

If she had been with another guy due to infatuation, and she told you about it then it means she is still loyal to you. Yes, you heard me right.
Guys see loyalty only at physical level. Girls see loyalty at Emotional level. If she shares you something very intimate, something that can potentially endanger her relationship, she has been loyal to you. In fact girls expect the guys to be emotionally mature in such cases. Because, adultery is not a new concept to this world. So get over it.
On the contrary. She had hid the information, and you found it yourself. Then, you are going to be the one who is going to confront her. Talk to her as openly as possible, and invite her to discuss the lapse. Girl might feel offended, when a boyfriend interferes in her personal life. Just assure her that, you are straightening out things by discussing. Girls too have temptations and desires, it is understandable.
If her emotional loyalty is at stake after the discussion, then it is better to be good friends with her. Be clear on this point, and respectfully distance yourself. No messages. No arguments. Most of all, don’t talk financial settlements. Be a man…
Most importantly talk to your close friend (female friend would be helpful) about such a thing has happened. Share your sadness. Cry a river, if required. Give yourself a week or a month to griev the loss and get over it.
You deserve someone better, and that better person is “You” first. Remember."

Seems simple to say, you might counter. I tried this and failed many times. The secret is training your mind to counter the jealous thoughts. Mindset has to be changed along with the way you are thinking.

Guys think girls are very stable and have lot of confidence.Use this to your advantage. Love yourself and groom yourself very well. Think of yourself as the princess. This is your starting point.
Be on and off: All you have to do is be attentive to him one or two days and then ignore him for 3 days. Wait on his every word for one hour and then don't give any sign of attraction towards him.
Be visual: Next use your eyes to convey what you want and see him like how you will see a cute child who is trying to get something from you. When you use your eyes, be aware of your own reactions towards him. How you feel is more important.
Be unpredictable: Fight with him on petty issues, like saying you don't like the color of his shirt, the way he eats or talks. Jus for the fun of it, make him do things. Then ignore him.
Be Kind: Fourth and finally listen actively to him. Listening to someone is basic kindness. Means, after he says something listen and tell in your words what he said. This when used correctly will become very seductive.
Being seductive is a forgotten art form that every girl had to learn. You have taken the first step. Way to go."

Seldom, our thoughts are our own. Even the mind that we have, is not entirely inside our brain. Brain only is a sense organ which can sense your and our mind.
The interest that you are talking about, does it resonate with you? When you do that activity, do you feel excited, or energetic. Like, I love reading novels, and talking philosophy, so on. Well, how do you feel? If that you are interested makes you love yourself, then you are genuinely interested.

There you have the first point that needs your attention. The thinking of most developers, and engineers are locked in the blaming mode. Not everything happens to you is because, you chose an option. Life unlike programming logic, has lots of other causal relations. The moment you see life as something that is to live, and enjoy then you see the options to do exactly that. Change the perspectives of your thoughts.
See if you can answer the question, “What I value from the bottom of my heart?” If what you answer is what you are doing, then in fact you are living your life to the fullest. If you don’t get a clear answer, then let your attention to stay on that question and see what answer surfaces up. This activity has to be done everyday, and see where it takes you.
Even though I am mechanical engineer by training and sales manager by profession, I know the value of Developing a software. You have a unique skill, which can be used in many ways. Spending time with creative softwares, sci-fi books, mathematical ideas, trying projects that you wanted to do as a child now that you have more power and experience. You will be fascinated with how much happiness it brings.
Finally, try teaching the unique skills that you have learnt through your developing experience. Look at the various problems you faced, and how did you solve them in your early work life. How are you solving them now? How will you solve them in future? Think temporally, and start writing out the ideas. Who knows, where it will take and who it would help."
