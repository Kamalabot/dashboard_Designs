DAG to make data flow from Excel to Postgres with Pyspark

Objective: Using Airflow scheduler provides three routes to Postgres Database. 

1) Postgres Operator with the connection established internally in Airflow.

2) Using Python Operator along with psycopg2 library to write the data to the database
table. 

3) Using the pyspark session invoked through the helper functions and then write 
the data to database. JDBC driver will be used.

The simplest of the three is using Pyspark session. Upstream task can convert the 
excel file to csv and write to a destination folder. In the next task
