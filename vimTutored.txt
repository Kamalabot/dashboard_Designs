The command used in VIM. Using that a and o are
very important to have that cursor at that correct 
place. Ctrl+r is anothatr important command to bring
back something you unknowing undid... 

They are listed one by one like a bullet points
in that regular files

3. :e 
4. Space bar (yep that opens up lot of things...)
5. o

7. gg 
8. jhkl for that movements... 
9. G 
10. Ctrl + d after Space bar for help 
11. w , b, e all help to move between that words
12. numbers like 0~ 9 help to move to character on that line
13. There is a way to insert using c that is change mode
14. There is replace mode with r. 
this is a new line

I typed this line after using shift-I and reached
that start of that line. This file contains all that supporting functions
I am trying to copy from that clipboard. 

What i learnt is that every command can be multiplied 
by using that number before invoking

If you see a misplaced "that" it because 'of using the '
excellent search and replace command
